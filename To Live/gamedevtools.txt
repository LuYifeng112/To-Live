"You awake?"

The faint figure was only a silhouette in my half opened eyes.

I had waited so long for him to arrive I had fallen asleep in this god awful
uncomfortable chair.

Choice: I'm awake

No choice chosen.

???
"That's good."

The silhouette moved around a bit more as I tried to gain focus.

???
"It is important you answer these questions properly."

???
"I will go through them one by one."

???
"Alright?"

Choice: ...

No choice chosen.

???
"Do not fret."

Fang Jie
"Yes I understand."

???
"Good."

???
"We're here for you."

???
"Let's get this over with."

That thought was calming to me.

Tough times needed tough people or support.

In this case I knew what {i}I{/i} needed.

I knew I had screwed up...

Protesting and rebelling.

Showing the power of a voice without hope.

Of harsh unfiltered criticism.

What should I expect?

Choice: {i}That was my choice; thus my consequence.{/i}
Choice: {i}Justice being punished is just proof of a unjust leadership.{/i}

No choice chosen.

Times are getting intense these days.

We are on the edge of total war - {i}again{/i}.

I began to adjust my eyes and get used to who was around me.

Resting my eyes on the previously known "Silhouette" I recognised him as
"Professor Po-YeurtTarng".

Professor Po Yeutarng is a lawyer who is quite well connected wtih Kuomintang
"Hawks".

"Hawks" in the sense that they perch on your shoulder and are aggressive in
every action they take.

The Professor's very close with my uncle "Ku Hong-Meng".

A scholar who used to work in Peking before he became "enlightened" in a
lifestyle of spiritual content and cosmic toiling.

A full time Taoist in essence.

Professor Po Yeutarng on request of Uncle Ku had come to interview me to clear
of any charges or suspicions with communist acivity.

All three of us knew that I was in no way connected with communists or had any
clear sympathies for them.

The interview still had to be carried out superficially... just to clear my
name.

It was also a good oppurunity to evaluate my situation and possible choices.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Are you Ready Fang?"

Choice: Yes I am Ready.
Choice: Please Give me a minute to think.

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well Let us start now."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The hawks want to know more about you this will information will help you
reflect on what you want to do with the looming war."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War's harsh isn't it?"

Professor Po bit his lip and focussed on the blank piece of paper in front of
him.

Fang Jie
"Yeah it is..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Lets start off with being realistic."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Your hometown."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What is your background in terms of location?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I know you and your family have moved places over the years..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's best to choose what is your go-to "home"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Where is it most convenient for you to return home? What would your gut
feeling say?"

Choice: Peiping
Choice: Nanking
Choice: Kwangchow
Choice: Hong-Kong
Choice: Macau
Choice: Taiwan

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Well, the capital is a good place."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Nationalists would fight to the death to keep it safe."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt the Japanese would get that far to Nanking anyway."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt it too. I can't predict how the war will go, but the capital city
will be heavily defended."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Your hometown seem to be out of harms way and strife."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The only issue is that it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"What's wrong with that?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's an international settlement area."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the Opium wars and the onset of unequal treaties an international zone
was established."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's under Kuomintang sovereignty but areas of it are allocated to the
French, British etc."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"While the Japanese don't have any legal right that I'm aware of they have an
"unofficial settelemt" in Kongkew."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's called "Little Tokyo"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"That means Shanghai is the gateway to Chinese territory."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"If you're going to be in Nanking you have to be aware of that."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They might as well just leap frog the legal framework of the Shanghai
International Zone."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War is chaotic and often..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Unpredictable."

Uncle Ku has listened with extreme curisoity.

It seemed this was the first time he had learnt about the legal status of
Shanghai.

Fang Jie
"That's so interesting."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I could be a military strategist with this much analytical skill."

He gave a dry laugh.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Anyway lets get going with the questions."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So what are you doing in Peiping right now?"

Choice: Attending school as a student.
Choice: Working as a scholarly apprentice under my uncle
Choice: Working here to send money back home.
Choice: Taking a break after military conscription training

No choice chosen.

{font=fonts/eng_octin_spraypaint/octin spraypaint a rg.ttf}{color=#4fc1ff}Fang
gained 3 Determination; 3 Intellect and 2 Dexterity!{/color}{/font}

Fang Jie
"I came here to actually continue my education."

Fang Jie
"I am staying with Uncle Ku since it is close to the facilities."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt schools will run under foreign occupation."

Professor Po gave a faint grin.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well classes won't."

Professor Po raised his glass of {i}Máotái{/i} and took a sip.

He normally didn't drink heavily but Uncle Ku had handed him this as a token
of thanks for visiting me.

Giving such an expensive drink symbolised Uncle Ku's gratitude.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most students back in Dongbei would just live at the boarding school."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They would not return to their families."

He raised the cup of {i}Máotái{/i} to his lips but didn't take a sip. {w}As if
something important crossed his mind.{w=1.2}

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the first month a few homesick students did in fact return."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"No vandalism, no abusive powers and the old deposed emperor back on a
throne."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most parents made kids work back on the farms or their old shanty businesses
while the Japanese and {i}Kang-te Pu Yi{/i} tried to get the old ways running
again."

I could make out the sorrow in his face.{nw}

It seemed he made himself remember something he wished to forget.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So I guess you should head back."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I think your family will need you more."

He looked down at his papers as he dipped the brush back into a clay pot of
ink and scribed some details on a creased paper.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What belief system do you follow?"

Choice: Taoism and Confucianism
Choice: Buddhism
Choice: Christianity

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"You seem to be clinging on the old ways."

Professor Po sipped his {i}Máotái{/i} lightly before facing me.

Bits of his face had manifested a gradient of red.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I guess the Kuomintang did a good job reinforcing tradition."

He sipped one again. {w}{cps=*0.5}As if something was annoying him
inside{/cps}.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Confucianism is a very old principle."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I...{w}{cps=*2}just don't see it going anywhere in the modern era.{/cps}"

Uncle Ku looked at him strangely.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The "New Life movement" is an illusion."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I am not a "communist" {w}but I don't like the policies of the nationalists
either."

Professor Po seemed engrossed with his political beliefs.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I respect your beliefs {i}Xiǎo Fāng{/i} but...{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"From a philosophical and political doctrine I dislike the state being an
obstacle to modernism."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I could agree with that.{nw}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"In english they say something along the lines of "seperation of church and
state"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Still, I persist, I believe in Confucianism."

Ku Hong-Meng
"It worked for 2000 years why can't it work for another 2000?"

Uncle Ku had seemed to have taken offence to Professor Po's anti-Confucian
stance.

Fang Jie
"I have a neutral atttiude to Confucianism."

Fang Jie
"I think some things work and some do not."

Fang Jie
"Fillial Piety is one of my core beliefs."

Prossor Po smirked.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The things you say become more interesting as I get more drunk."

Professor Po seemed to dip his brush more sloppily and scribe less cautiously.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Fillial Piety..."

I hope he didn't broach the subject.

The fact that he wasn't sober meant that there was a chance he would bring up
a topic I didn't like...

Professor Po Yeutarng
"But isn't it, like, ummm, uhh..."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Lets get back to the itnerview."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Now is not the time to discuss such matters."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"bu-{nw}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Come on,"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The poor boy has been so patient."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Let's not waste his time."

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's important to him to leave fast and unite with his family."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What f-{nw}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Just understand."

Uncle Gu had expertly steered the conversation away despite Professor Po's
drunk demeanor manifesting.

In regards to professor Po, I wondered if he was capable of asking another
question.

I hope he would have enough capaicity to finish to interview before he became
too drunk.

Every second I'm here... it feels more dangerous.

Perhaps I'm prone to overthinking but I just wanted to leave Peiping.

I don't have the strength to persist through violence.

Nor do I have time to indulge in my personal family matters.

I would have asked Uncle Ku why he ever told Professor Po something that was
supposed to be so personal to me.

To an extent this did piss me off.

Truth is these days things like total war are a biger worry than some petty
gossip.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Fang!"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Stay alert a litte bit longer then you go think about whatever you want."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I'm doing my best as well."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Let's keep going."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wait,"

Ku Hong-Meng
"{i}Fang{/i}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Did you read the old poems from {i}"Tao Te Ch'ing"{/i}?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Would you like to hear a poem from {i}Tao Te Ch'ing{/i}?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"{i}Tao the water way{/i}"

Fang Jie
"I already know the poem."

Professor Po seemed to increasingly become unable to stay...{w=1.0}sober.

Ku Hong-Meng
"He might need to take some rest."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He grew up around the drink."

Uncle Ku grabbed Professor Po by his arms and mounted him on his back.

Professor Po only slurred some words as Uncle Ku dragged him to a guest room.

I guess{w=1.0} the interview will be conducted later.

I turned my head around to the Taoist Shrine.

It consisted of a {i}Yīnyáng{/i} emblem,{w=0.5} A candle that possessed a
mediocre flame,{w=0.5} and a copy of {i}Tao Te Ch'ing{/i}.

I stood up from the uncomfortable chair and approached the shrine.

It was peaceful to stand before the shrine.

I wasn't required to announce my presence.

Part of me was afraid of the new world I had stepped into.

Will the gods protect me?

Thoughts invaded my mind as I looked at the shrine.

Judgement
But you have to stay focussed.

Judgement
Overtinking will not be useful to you this way.

Judgement
You should try to calm down and think.

Lúgōuqiáo Shìbiàn had begun only a few days ago.

Uncle Ku ambled out of the guest room with his hands concealed under his
robes.

He grimaced slightly at the situation.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't know what will come out of this."

He seemed to say that calmly.

Something so important...{w=1} taken so lightly.

Fang Jie
"That's fine...{w=1} I can deal with that."

Uncle Ku sat down at the shrine and opened Tao Te Ch'ing.

He was a commited reader and devotee.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go outside and find something to do."

I looked back at Uncle Ku.

He could only sigh.

That was all he could do.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}Don't worry{/cps}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"We can get ut of here in time."

Uncle Ku would reguarly meet in the village centre and talk to elders and
intelectuals about current events.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Japan is mobilising an army, they won't go further than Peiping-Tientsen,
{w=1}I've heard."

Uncle Ku felt hopeless.

Staring into those eyes felt like lies.

Fang Jie
"They keep taking from us."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I know..."

Uncle Ku didn't believe in violence,{w=1.0} he didn't feel the need to fight
back.

I had lost my composure.

I could see Uncle Ku's reaction to me lashing out after such a long time.

Pressure that had built up from everything had finally burst the bottle.

Uncle Ku looked at me solenmly.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}I'm sorry,{w=1} Fang.{/cps}"

Fang Jie
"I'm sorry too."

I turned my back and walked out of the door.

Ku Hong-Meng
"If there is a air raid just run straight to some air raid shelter."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you find a German one, priorotise that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"The German peoples don't get harassed by {i}guizi{/i}."

I had crossed the Er-men.

I kept on walking until I passed through the Da-men.

Outside was a little garden where my Great Grandfather had planted a Sakura
Tree for Sun Yat Sen's new era of the Republic.

It's a real shame I never even learnt his name despite knowing how well known
he was in this local place.

My great grandfather disliked the Qing as they were Manchus as opposed to the
Ming who were a Han Chinese dynasty.

He had a wealthy wine business which gave him the money to buy a large
{i}Siheyuan{/i}

The Sakura was planted to mark the growth a new era without the Qing.

The Sakura plant was also foreign and thus showcased his wealth when he had it
planted.

Everything I ever learnt about him indicated that...{w=1} wealth controlled
his choices.

Sadly he died before he realised how the Republic failed China.

{cps=*0.45}or the shortlived Empire before the warlord era.{/cps}

Beyond the Sakura tree was a pond he had hired workers to build.

Apart from showing off his wealth he would also use this pond to grow Lotuses.

He would grow them in bulks and sell them to Buddhists and Buddhist temples in
which he would get blessed and make money.

now..{w=1} he wasn't shallow that he did that for profit.

He was a devout buddhist.

He would donate large sums of charity to people in need and temples.

I kept walking on until the pond came into view.

Black and white pictures showed budding and blossomed Lotuses on the surface
of the water.

Earlier photos even had swans in them.

What I saw in front of me was neither.

The water was brown, murky and thick.

It was hard to believe anything nice was in there anymore.

Uncle Ku refused to spend his inheritance money on refurbishing things around
the house.

He dared not indulge in materialism and wealth of any kind.

He preferred and carried a metaphorical banner of being a rich man in poor
clothing.

I stared at the pathetic pond.

The pond that gave up on life.

Gave up on struggling.

I turned around fast before facing Lao-Chang.

We called him that because he was an old milkman who didn't want to
retire.{nw}

Hence the name "old Chang".

Fang Jie
"I would agree."

Fang Jie
"That would have been better for the community."

Lao Chang
"We have a groundwater well over on the other side that was dug by Ma Wen's
father."

Lao Chang
"It's near the animals a lot, people are scared that they'll find chicken
shit."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku is a miser wearing the mask of Taoism."

Lao Chang
"That's your opinion."

Lao Chang
"I'm sure if we held a petition he would support it."

Fang Jie
"Really?"

I wasn't sure if that would suspend my disbelief.

Lao Chang
"Calling him a miser won't do him justice."

Lao Chang
"He isn't the kind of person who spends money on themselves."

Lao Chang
"He would rather spend it to support others."

He was old enough to know how everyone functioned in this community.

Fang Jie
"If you ask him, he will."

Lao Chang laughed.

Lao Chang
"You remind me of your grandpa."

Lao Chang sat down on the damp grass next to me that faced the miserable pond.

Fang Jie
"How so?"

Lao Chang
"Whenever there was war...{w=1} the fella just got into a bad mood."

Lao Chang
"During the northern expedition when Chiang Chieh-shih tried to take back from
those warlords.."

Lao Chang
"He had a sulky mood for a week."

Lao Chang dug his hand into the basket tied to his bicycle and took out a rice
snack.

Lao Chang
"You see. {w=1}His sister was back in Kwangchow where this crazy reunifier was
wailing war and unifying cities under his control."

Lao Chang
"He wouldn't get any of her letters from kwangchow so he sulked."

Lao Chang bit into his rice snack and chewed it open mouthed.

Lao Chang
"He sent out a lot of letters to."

Lao Chang
"I wonder where they went."

Lao Chang gazed at the shitty pond. Like it was beautiful as my Great-
Grandfather had left it.

Lao Chang
"Eventually you got this shithole situation where there are so many warlords
and everyone wants to crown a new China."

Lao Chang
"Who do you think will crown a new China?"

Choice: Chiang Chie Shih
Choice: Wang Ching Wei
Choice: Li Tsung-Jen
Choice: Mao Tse-Tung
Choice: I don't know

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think Chiang Chie Shih"

Fang Jie
"He has proclaimed central government."

Fang Jie
"The warlords even cooperate with him."

Fang Jie
"It's more or less if he can centralize power to one form of government."

Lao Chang
"That's a good bet."

Lao Chang
"The national Revolutionary Army rolled over everyone in the Northern
Camapaign."

Lao Chang
"If they keep those troops moralised Dr Sun's democracy will come back to us."

Lao Chang stood up and patted off the back of his pants that had attracted
clumps of damp soil.

Lao Chang
"I gotta get going."

Lao Chang
"Wanna buy a bottle of milk?"

Lao Chang
"You can take it home early."

Fang Jie
"No thanks, I don't have cash."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku will pay for it at the doorstep."

Lao Chang
"I guess that suits it."

Lao Chang grabbed the handles of his makeshift bike and pushed it around.

THe odd thing about Lao Chang was that he would have a bike he would never
ride.

He would just use the basket and push it for ease.

Since he was twice the age of Uncle Ku it made sense.

The bicycle was also too small for him. {w=1}I would have assumed that this
was something thrown away by the child of some wealthy family who grew out of
the bike.

I observed Lao Chang walk off in the distance, pushing his bike and the
flicking the rusted bell that wouldn't make any sound. {w=1}That was because
there was nothing for it to strike against.

I turned and began to walk the other way.

It was a five minute walk away from the village center.

Most young boys or able men would not be welcome there.

This was because young or able men would get kidnapped by the Kuomintang army
and chained and walked down to military headquarters to forcefully enlist.

These days the reports of Kuomintang barging and taking had gone down.

My shoes rubbed in the dirt pass as I ambled on.

In 2 weekss of residing in this district I had started to memorise a map of
the place.

There were a few facilities I was going to walk past.

The most interesting was the brothel.

The sex industry had grown in Manchuria and many boys would talk about it in
the alley ways.

Over here the brothel was something that you should not be seen entering and
leaving if you wanted to have a sense of dignity.

This brothel was known as a {i}Chang San{/i} brothel.

It was like an artistic form of prostituition in which the prositute would
play the lyre, do calligraphy and do paintings.

I think it was a progressive way to humanise prostitutes.

Personally I have never interacted with a prosititute.

Nor do I have a good enough reason to.

I just don't understand their stigma in society.

Many of the girls are of varying ages from 13 to early 40s.

The place was not regulated much with ramapnt bribing and blackmail.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hey Fang!"

I turned to see her sitting in a chair outside the door.

Fang Jie
"Hey"

I did a faint wave.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Is that a wave?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"Relax, {w=1}waving back to me won't make me pounce on you."

She crossed her arms and smiled at me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have my principles."

She grinned.

I didn't know how to respond to her.

All I could give her was an awkward grin.

She giggled at my response.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hard to believe{cps=*0.4}...{/cps}{w=1}Some {i}whore{/i} has a sense of
principle. Right?"

I looked at the ground.

At this point I had trouble making any form of eye contact.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Don't feel bad, little brother."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean, my rules are I don't drink,{w=1} I don't smoke and I don't condone
violence."

She leaned back on her chair against the chipped brick blocks.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have a band of sisters to look after. People in my situation."

I couldn't keep being judged like this.

I felt a need to spit it out.

Fang Jie
"I don't see whatever you're doing as a bad thing."

I interrupted her mid sentence.

She gave a strange look.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Litte brother, if some alleyboy said those words to me, I'd think it's some
ploy for pity lovemaking."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I know my stigma,{cps=*1.2} don't pity me..{/cps}"

She was still in a good mood for some odd reason.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You know, the conflict happening up there doesn't bother me."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If the Japanese do take over, we will just be required to service their
soldiers instead."

She closed her eyes to laugh at herself.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean the industry is booming in Dong-bei, so things around here will change
I guess."

Fang Jie
"Alley boys told you right?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean who else will?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"it's nice talking to a non-pervert for once."

Chang San Brothel worker
"It's amazing how people can have fruitful conversations if you give them a
chance. Right Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Right."

How did she know my name?

Fang Jie
"How do you know my name?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"The other girls you flirt with when they sit outside told me so."

I felt my face go red.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You talk better to the ones your age."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I'm only a few years your senior. {w=1}A solid 19 year old."

Chang San Brothel worker
"You're disappointed. Aren't you?"

She was teasing me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"By the way, my name is Wang Yuelan."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If you ever need shelter, just ask {i}Xiao Wen{/i} to share the room."

She laughed as she opened the door and walked inside.

Rhetorics
She's implying you should use their services if you need shelter.

Rhetorics
After all you will {b}stay the night{/b} there by any way.

Vice
Well would you?

Choice: I don't indulge in such vices.
Choice: Maybe when I'm more "curious".

No choice chosen.

Vice
Playing good guy?

Vice
What a bore.

Vice
I guess it's your "choice".

Interesting indeed.

They were an interesting bunch,{w=1} strange but interesting.

I kept on walking along the dirt path.

The ambient noises from the brothel faded away with my distance.

I kept walking on.

Each step one by one.

The next facility I would see would be the winery my Great Grandpa owned.

Uncle Ku had sold it when he inherited it from his father.

Uncle Ku didn't want to support himself by destroying the lives of addicts.

At first he kept it out of operation.

It would sit there 5-6 years...{w=1}undisturbed.

Then officials would come and start ordering him to do something productive
with that land and facilities.

After a few months he sold it off to some businessman from Shanghai who wished
to expand their winery business.

Now I walk past it and just look at how many cycles this building has
experienced.

I was never told why this building was built intially, since my Great
Grandfather just decided to occupy this empty place for good business.

His father ran a little business from his home.{w=1}So my Great Grandpa
decided what to do,

He moved all his stuff there and took care of it.

Eventually people began to think this abandoned building didn't host any curse
or haunted by any angry spirits.

Some wealthy people like the Ma family invested in the winery and it grew
bigger.

In about 3 years the bulding had been expanded to four times its intial size.

Over 70 people worked here for good pay.

My Great Grandpa built an expensive Siheyuan and began to live lavishly like
the Ma family.

He died believing resourcefulness and willpower outperforms fate.

I would get told all about this from the locals like Lao Chang or Ah-Mei the
educated daughter of a noble family residing here.

Eventually passing the collosal winery I began to see the village centre in
sight.

It wasn't a centre where you would assume it was a meeting spot.

It was a noodle shop run by the Guo family.

Everyone would come and eat there once in a while and that became the de-facto
village centre.

It was run by two brothers around my age.

The older was Guo Heng, who took over the shop when his father passed away
from a stroke two years ago.

He raised his younger brother to learn to cook as well.

Eventually they got their skills developed and Guo Heng got to send his
brother "Guo He" to school.

I have met Guo Heng only a few times,{w=0.5} but he is very interesting to
talk to.

He has developed a passion for making all kinds of noodles.

Last time I visited him he showed me his father's recipe that had been handed
down for god knows how long.

He offered to employ me to his noodle shop if I ever needed a place to work.

Despite being 23 years old Guo Heng was arguably graying from his stress.{w=1}
Something he always loved joking about with the other villagers.

The noodle shop even had a banner which would ostentaciously show off its
wealth and success.

In short, if there was any celebration, meeting, or festival, Guo's noodle
shop was the place.

Mostly because it was the most central and most convenint for everyone to meet
at.

I passed through and entered the store.

Guo Heng had sat on a table and was appying a dirty rag to wipe the sweat off
his face.

The summer sun was strong and it didn't help he cooked behind a fire all day.

Guo Heng seemed to age faster everytime I visited him.

His body had become more built and skinny while his face became browner with
more wrinkles.

His hair had remained the same, {w=1}Little whisks of grey popping out once in
an occassional spot.

Guo Heng looked up at me with his brown eyes that resembled foreign
manufactured chocolate.

Guo Heng
"Fang!{w=1}{nw}"

I sat down opposite on the same table he was sitting at.

Fang Jie
"Hey, Heng"

It was midday and the sun was now forcing its heated will on us like spears.

At the highest point in the sky, a false inferno had formed.

Fang Jie
"You must hate the sun so much if you go through this everyday."

Guo Heng gave a smirk and dabbed his white dirtied rag on his face.

His shirt had wet patches near his armpits and chest.

Guo Heng
"I think its fair."

Fang Jie
"How is this fair?"

Guo Heng was quite wise because the elders would gather here and include him
in philosophical talks.

Guo Heng
"There are two things in this world which are fair."

Guo Heng
"THese two things never judge...{w=1}never discriminate."

He dabbed the cloth on his face again.

Guo Heng
"The first is death. In this world God and the Devil may judge you, but death
will come for you, no matter how good,{w=1}how bad, or whatever you are."

Guo Heng
"Death doesn't pick favourites."

Guo Heng
"The Second is the sun."

Guo Heng
"For Aeons the Sun had given light regardless of the morality of the creature
receiving it."

Guo Heng
"The sun when it's too hot will feel this way to everyone."

Guo Heng
"If the sun isn't judging than whatever the sun does,{w=1}is fair."

Fang Jie
"You really learn some interesting stuff from those elders."

Guo Heng
"I know right."

Guo Heng
"They don't have anything to do, so i give them discounted noodles and educate
myself."

I looked up at the sky

It was clear and cloudless.

Fang Jie
"Don't you get worried about the Japanese?"

Heng looked up to the sky.

Guo Heng
"I heard they're readying air raid shelters because the Japanese are mobilsing
for a full attack."

Guo Heng
"Maybe I'll have to learn to cook Ramen."

Fang Jie
"What about your younger brother?"

Guo Heng
"I'm planning to send him to Nanking where he will be safer."

Heng dabbed the cloth on his face again.

His hair had beads of sweat bouncing but never dropping off.

Fang Jie
"Really?"

Guo Heng
"It's a good idea to evacuate before they start fighting."

Guo Heng
"Ma Wen told me that the Shanghai International Zone would become a passage of
entrance for the Japanese."

Guo Heng
"He advised me not to send Guo He to Shanghai."

Guo Heng
"Hence I chose Nanking."

Guo Heng
"The Japanese would probably confiscate the shop and make me do work without
profit."

Fang Jie
"That is true."

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Guo Heng
"The capital itself."

Guo Heng
"What is it like there?"

Guo Heng applied the rag to his sweaty face again.

Fang Jie
"Nanking in it's name means "Southern Capital"."

Fang Jie
"The first time it ruled a united China was in the Ming Dynasty."

Fang Jie
"It's a nice place to live overall."

Fang Jie
"It has a powerful inland port and it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"If you're rich then you're like a foreigner.{w=1} You dress pretty or look
handsome."

Fang Jie
"There's a lot of people there and you even have western Churches propped up
in some places of the city."

Fang Jie
"Due to these churches, chinese children of Christian believers learn English
well and proficiently."

Guo Heng looked at me bewildered.

Guo Heng
"Can you speak English?"

He looked so excited for some reason.

Fang Jie
"A bit,{w=1} I can communicate a good amount with some American residents."

Guo Heng
"What other kind sof foreigners are there in Nanking?"

I sat back and thought a little.

Fang Jie
"You have German businessmen from the German Reich with their families that
settle her to manage German businesses in China."

Fang Jie
"Some German military officiers also train Chinese troops, like General
Alexander von Falkenhausen."

Fang Jie
"He is the military advisor to Chiang Chieh-Shih for their joint military
reform program."

Fang Jie
"You have Japanese people too, who initially settled in the Japanese sector of
Shanghai and moved to Nanking but you don't see them around too often."

Fang Jie
"Other europeans are rare to see, apart from some British who do business with
Americans."

Guo Heng
"I guess Nanking is becoming a global city."

Fang Jie
"I'd say the same thing."

Guo Heng
"At least foreigners are cooperating rather than invading us.{w=1} Apart from
Japan."

Guo Heng cursed under his breath.

He dabbed the rag once again.

Guo Heng
"Is there anything special in the capital city of the republic?"

Fang Jie
"There is a statue of Chiang Chieh-Shih in the middle of the city."

Guo Heng
"What about Dr Sun?"

Fang Jie
"He doesn't need a statue."

Fang Jie
"He has a big Mausoleum called "Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum" which I think gives his
legacy justice."

Guo Heng
"What's in the Mausoleum now?"

Fang Jie
"A marble sarcophagus."

Fang Jie
"and a ceiling with the Kuomintang sun stretching above."

Guo Heng
"How's house arrest been?"

Fang Jie
"It's been fine."

Fang Jie
"I've managed to learn more about my "ancestral land"."

Fang Jie
"Sadly I can't stay here for long."

Guo Heng
"Why so?"

Fang Jie
"There's a war going to start."

Guo Heng
"I guess that makes sense."

There was nothing to say.

It was a bit awkward but it was difficult to articulate conversation.

I don't have in the slightest an idea of what to do.

Choice: Keep conversing with Guo Heng.
Choice: Take leave

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think its time I get moving."

Fang Jie
"I have a pending interview to undergo."

Fang Jie
"He should be coming to conduct it soon."

Guo Heng rubbed the rag on his face.

Guo Heng
"I have to work anyway."

Guo Heng
"It was nice to talk with you Fang."

Guo Heng stood up.

Guo Heng put down his sweat rag.

The sun was piercing through his thin ragged shirt.

You could see how the sweat now made the shirt a paint to his canvas of a
skin.

Guo Heng
"No offense Fang,"

Guo Heng
"I have work now."

Guo Heng
"I can't afford always taking a break."

Guo Heng
"It takes time to make preparations for a meal."

Guo Heng stood up.

I grinned at him as well.

It was pleasant.

Guo Heng was now slaving away in his kitchen once again.

I stood up and walked outside and began to think.

Visiting the village temple was an opportunity to calm myself down and think
about life.

I'd often get to sit and think.

It was almost as quite as the libraries in Peking University.

The temple wasn't far from Guo's noddle shop.

I began to amble to my destination.

The temple had been around since the inception of the village.

It was the oldest unchanged object in this whole place.

It is rumored that the village was built by rich landowning elites in the Ming
dynasty.

It would make sense to see why this village is prosperous more than most.

Apart from that there is also a gilded reputation of this place.

It is prosperous but on the backs of laborers and rural wanderers or military
deserters.

People like {i}Ma Shih{/i} often hired these desperate people for cheap and
made them do things well beyond their pay.

It's no rumor that a few times a month the newly hired workers on his farm are
either hospitalized or were seen running away.

Lao Chang used to work for Ma Shih's father who was a complete opposite in
fact.

Lao Chang deifies that man because of him Lao Chang had a place to stay and
never felt an empty stomach for 15 or so years.

Then he died and his cheap cruel son took over the farm and made it much more
sinister.

Its a thought that keeps me up at night.

Maybe it's why these poor dis-empowered people turn to communism.

After all why defend something that oppresses you?

As I keep walking, other thoughts amble into my mind.



I knelt down and kept my eyes closed.

I was so calm I could hear my own heartbeat.

Monk
"How are you feeling?"

I opened my eyes once more.

Monk
"You seem much more calm than when you entered this place."

A monk wearing the Taoist robes was standing in front of me with a inviting
smile.

Monk
"I'm glad to see that."

The monk turns around and orders a temple worker something in a foreign
language.

Monk
"Don't take offense to that."

Monk
"I speak in my dialect."

Monk
"I just told him to bring you some water."

Monk
"This temple is just as much of a house for me and him."

Monk
"That's why all visitors are treated as guests."

Monk
"I would just like to request we do not entertain ourselves to discussion
here."

Monk
"It's a place of worship."

Fang Jie
"Ah.. Sure."

Monk
"Thanks for understanding."

I follow the Monk into a small room.

Monk
"This place was donated to by Ma-Shih."

Monk
"I'm happy that he is so generous to us."

Monk
"That man I asked to get water for you used to work for Ma-Shih."

Monk
"He took refuge here 2 winters ago."

Monk
"Ma-Shih fearing for his existence gave colossal donations to the temple as a
result."

Monk
"I wonder if such acts bear one fruit."

Monk
"What would you think?"

Choice: People fear ruining their eternal afterlife.
Choice: People are naturally selfish.
Choice: In the end it doesn't matter, it's better to live nicer when alive.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"They seem to act in self interest a lot of the time."

Fang Jie
"I think it's not fair that one can be cruel and then expect to be free from
their consequence."

Monk
"You aren't wrong there."

Monk
"But did you ever think he gave up something that enabled him material power?
A portion of wealth?"

Monk
"Such thoughts shouldn't plague ones mind."

Monk
"Allowing things to be carried on your shoulders mentally is what creates the
burden and worrying we want to run away from."

Monk
"I don't know your story."

Monk
"I don't know why you came in here looking so upset before your "prayer"."

Monk
"I'm glad you have subdued your frustrations."

Monk
"but you must learn to control them at will."

The temple servant strolled in with a glass of water.

I assume they had to use the temple well to get the water which would explain
the wait.

Monk
"Do you recognize him?"

I looked over at the fresh face of the temple servant.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid not."

Monk
"He is Ma-Wen. The son of Ma-Shih."

Ma Wen
"Namaste."

He did a slight bow as he did this.

Ma Wen
"Have some water to drink."

Fang Jie
"Sure.. Thank you."

Ma Wen
"You're welcome."

I picked up the glass of water and drank it down to drown my sense of
surprise.

Ma Wen
"Don't drink so fast."

Ma Wen took a seat on the same bench as the Monk.

Ma Wen
"It's true, I am Ma-Shih's son."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: Why did you of all people run away?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: What about the rest of your family?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Yeah."

Ma Wen
"I probably won't get an inheritance either."

Ma Wen
"Nothing to return to."

Ma Wen
"So I'm going to try and live a good life wherever I may be."

Monk
"Quite the story."

Monk
"I don't judge people so I took him in."

Monk
"Different lives don't matter as long there is mutual respect."

Monk
"When he came here, he was just like you."

Monk
"Everyone has a struggle."

Monk
"Listening to others will ease that feeling that no-one understands your
burdens."

Monk
"Stories are a window to empathy."

Ma Wen sat there unmoving.

He seemed eerily... stolid.

Monk
"I'm here to talk if you want."

Monk
"What about you Ma-Wen?"

Ma Wen looks up from the floor.

Ma Wen
"I shoud attend to some duties."

Monk
"I guess that's alright."

Ma Wen ambled out the door.

Despite that I could still feel his cloud of melancholy.

Monk
"Don't overthink it."

Monk
"It will take time for him to come to terms with these feelings."

Monk
"Self hate is a poison in which time is its antidote."

Fang Jie
"I guess I can agree with that."

The Monk retreats back into his mind to think for a moment.

Monk
"You've only been around here for two weeks right?"

Fang Jie
"Yes, that's right."

Monk
"Why are you here?"

Fang Jie
"There's too many reasons for that."

Monk
"Will you walk South?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not sure about that."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to drop everything and run."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to get caught in crossfire."

Fang Jie
"Or enslaved by the army."

Monk
"All fair crticisms."

Monk
"I can't disagree with that."

Monk
"Have you talked to Ku Hsien-Sheng?"

Fang Jie
"No I have not yet..."

Monk
"I have a good feeling about you."

Monk
"I feel the same way about Ma-Wen."

Monk
"I won't be moving an inch from here."

Monk
"That is my personal choice."

Monk
"You..."

The monk looked at the ground for a second.

Monk
"You're young."

Monk
"You don't deserve to get invovled in this."

Monk
"You have a whole life ahead of you."

Monk
"Every choice you make counts."

Monk
"If you don't mind can you help me out with some serivce preparations?"

Monk
"It will be best to give Ma-Wen a rest for today."

I stand up and thank the Monk for his hospitality.

He doesn't reply but retort with a smile.

I walk past the rooms and the deity room to the outside wind.

The wind was gentle and inviting as I stood and absorbed it's chilled
sensations.



I seemed to have a lot of work left.

Normally I would be in the urban districts of Peiping where you could see
people from all places gather.

Even the Japanese across the Marco-Polo Bridge.

I would attend Peiping university so I could work abroad.

Strangely my dreams seem to force me to run away from my current situation.

I begin to walk back home as my books are there.

How would I confront Uncle Ku?

I felt like I has strained things again.

Part of me always does this.

Part of me always blames me for blaming myself for things outside of my
control.

I realize I always dwell on such trivial matters.

It's strange really.

I guess this walk didn't get me anything.

I felt my leather shoes grind the dust as I ambled.

Is my education even a priority?

{i}I should be evacuating... right?{/i}

The Chang San Brothel was now in view again.

Chang San was not even its name, it was just a type of brothel.

I never bothered asking the name anyway.

Was it important to know its name?

I began to speed-walk at this rate.

The wine factory that was supposed to be starting up soon will now be left
decrepit.

I wonder what the soldiers would do to it when they occupy it.

Yue-Lan has already expressed what the soldiers would do with the brothel
under occupation.

It didn't strike me as surprising in any sense.

They would probably start up the factory with some volunteers and drink till
they drop.

I kept on walking for what felt like 10 minutes until the pathetic pond came
back into view.

The pond in my eyes resembled an animal that was wounded and in pain.

Like it needed to be put out of its misery.

It would also be a breeding ground for ill stuff.

The water is brown and god knows that is swimming in there.

I gaze away and walk back in through the Da-men.

I couldn't hear Uncle Ku doing anything at the alter.

I wonder if he is home.

I have to find my books and start reading.

I chose courses in law at Peking university.

I seemed to have a strong sense of civil justice since I was young.

When you're a kid and you feel like the leadership has failed you then you
grow up wanting that to change.

Perhaps my determination to change a faulty system came from a hatred of its
failures.

I can't even understand my own intentions for such ambitions but I persist.

I reject the alternate options.

I dragged a book off of the shelf and put it on my table.

One day I wish I could become part of this system and hopefully steer it
towards a path for the better.

Time to study.

I recited the final quotes and notes to cement them in my head.

Studying like this has helped me become more calm.

It's all I have these days.

Working towards more work.

{i}I'm such a workaholic{/i}

Uncle Ku still hasn't come back even despite the fact I had studied to just
above an hour.

I wonder if he was called to a meeting.

Surely I would meet them on the way to Guo's shop.

Perhaps he was talking with some workers on building air raid shelters.

Uncle Ku is well connected with people in high places, perhaps an officer
informed him to undertake responsibility to dig air raid shelters.

After all they might start bombing any day soon when they're mobilized.

The thought of war...

It still haunts me.

Will people be able to keep their sanity after witnessing near death,
bloodshed and regular bombing?

In all honesty I have doubts on my capacity to handle the terrors of war.

I'm not some mythological hero who can fight till their last breath.

I just didn't want to be involved in this.

{i}Is that why I want to run away?{/i}

{i}If Uncle Ku and Professor Po realized this then this support for escaping
further south makes sense.{/i}

Beijing may be the resident of my ancestors but I have to face reality.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang?"

I sat up not expecting him to enter the house so silently.

Ku Hong-Meng
"What are you hung up about?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The hawks?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The communist accusations?"

Uncle Ku sat in silence for a few seconds before manifesting an idea.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're hung up on Li aren't you?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not."

Fang Jie
"It does make me guilty."

Fang Jie
"But what can I do?"

Fang Jie
"If he was in my place he wouldn't be doing anything for me either."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm not here to pinpoint whose fault it is that Li is in prison."

Fang Jie
"I know."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Did you even visit him?"

Fang Jie
"I don't want to raise suspicions that I really am in kahoots with treasonous
activity."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He was your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Could you do that to a friend?"

Fang Jie
"Would I want to put my life in danger further?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"And let him suffer?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're going to make him grow to hate you."

Fang Jie
"My hands are tied."

Fang Jie
"What can I do?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The professor has already left."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He said the questions he asked what enough to write a statement on you that
could get you out."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I guess you're out of the trouble now aren't you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Maybe do something similar for your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Don't throw your friend into a hole."

Choice: Don't worry. I know the right thing to do.
Choice: There are bigger things to worry about right now.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I won't stab him in the back like that."

Fang Jie
"I'll try and help him out when I have time."

Uncle Ku gave a pleasant smile upon hearing this.

By the way...

Fang Jie
"I've been thinking about it."

Fang Jie
"We should walk south far away from the conflict."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you crazy?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Why would you want to do that?"

Fang Jie
"To stay safe!"

Fang Jie
"Why else would I want to escape a bloodbath?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You are telling me that I should leave my land like food on a platter for
some invaders?"

Fang Jie
"If it means that we will live for another sunrise.."

Fang Jie
"then YES!"

Uncle Ku had a look of disbelief painted on his face.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you out of your mind?"

How the hell should I approach this?

Choice: They aren't like how they were in Manchuria.
Choice: Listen to yourself!

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"Do you honestly in your own right mind think that standing upright while they
carry guns will change anything?"

Fang Jie
"It may be nihilistic but"

Fang Jie
"In this scenario it's realistic."

Fang Jie
"We have to make concrete decisions now."

Choice: I'm leaving for South whether you like it or not
Choice: It will be better if you could come.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid I will have to go to Nanking."

Fang Jie
"I know this might be harsh but I don't want to leave you behind at all
costs."

Fang Jie
"That is why I need you to come with me."

Fang Jie
"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there some friend in Qingdao you can
contact?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I accept your goodwill and honest intentions for my safety."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I also have some disagreements."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You got accepted into Peking university."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You joined a protest about things that matter to you and to you only."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Now you are forcing my own hand to your will."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you noticed how self-entitled you are?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You've only been here two weeks and I'm starting to see a controlling trait
of yours emerging."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang you don't need to be {i}this{/i} rash."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm sorry."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I may be that old traditional thinking fundamentalist."

Ku Hong-Meng
"But my choices will remain my choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You can leave."

Uncle Ku sat on the guest bed.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any hard feelings from what is a natural response to fear and
danger."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Out of goodwill I can help prepare you."

Choice: Thank you.

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep your admission papers with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Peking university might move during wartime like any other kind of business."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Even after the war when it returns it will be nice to have your spot
guaranteed."

﻿--- Tue Jul 07 20:30:51 2020

Ku Hong-Meng
"Even after the war when it returns it will be nice to have your spot
guaranteed."

Uncle Ku scratched his head as he thought.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you still have the work recommendation letter from Cheung?"

Rhetorics
A rhetorical question.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep that with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you could find some kind hearted foreigner to work for then most of your
tantrums will go silent."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go to Tsingtao."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Over there I have an academic colleague by the name of Wang P'u Ch'en"

Ku Hong-Meng
"He's quite rich. Rich as me I would say."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He has a wife who is referred to as "Lady Wang"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Her full name is Wang Yue Hsiang but don't ever refer to her with that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I will write a letter to him explaining him to take you in for as long as you
need to be dependent on him or leave further south."

Ku Hong-Meng
"After all he owes me."

Choice: Why?

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I sponsored his education and accommodation with my house and inherited
wealth."

Ku Hong-Meng
"His success today is due to my input."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Since he owes me he can't turn you away."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt he would have turned you away even if he didn't owe me."

Ku Hong-Meng
"This sort of goodwill comes in handy down the line you see."

Uncle Ku kept on dabbing the brush in ink and sliding it elegantly across a
piece of paper approximately the size of a table-top world map.

Ku Hong-Meng
"By the way Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you heard of {i}I Kuan-Tao{/i}?"

Choice: No

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's a sect of a larger religious movement that gained popularity after the
fall of the Empire."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I Kuan-Tao is a belief of salvation of the individual and of society."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is actually studying about the sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I need to tell you two things in regards to it."

Ku Hong-Meng
"First you need to stay away from that sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"By that I mean don't believe in what they tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Besides you might get sucked into more obscure and shadowy organizations."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Secondly if you can help Wang P'u Ch'en gain insight into the organization
then you can prolong your stay with him indefinitely by paying him with
"intel"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Provided you don't fall victim to their lies."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is eying them carefully."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I put down in this letter than you might be willing to help him out on
learning about it in exchange for living space."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When you reach there make your own choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Here you go."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I forgot to tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Professor Po will stay in contact also."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He'll use his connections to help you out if you need help."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Just keep track of how much you {i}owe{/i} him."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Let me walk you off tonight."

Ku Hong-Meng
"God knows what will come out of this war."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When the war ends feel free to come back here."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Or go wherever else you want."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'll keep sending letters to you in Tsingtao unless the Japanese begin
intercepting them."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you do decide to go further south then inform me so that I can keep in
contact."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you have a torch or anything?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's pretty dark out there."

Choice: No

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any lanterns around."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Will you be able to make it still?"

Fang Jie
"Sure, I can."

Fang Jie
"Thanks for everything."

Uncle Ku gave a faint smile.

Something you don't normally expect from him.

It was nice I guess to be sent of with a smile.

even if I did speak to him like that.

I hope it didn't leave any hard feelings.

Fang Jie
"Time to meet Guo Heng again."

I might have to make a choice on a whim tonight.

I could plan it out with Guo Heng and quickly pack to go on ahead.

I would still need to talk to Uncle Ku about this.

I should try to make him leave with us to Tsingtao for the timebeing.

Then we can make more long term decisions about how to go up against the war.

Besides with Uncle Ku on our side the financial aspect of the group will be
fixed.

By now the sun was setting.

Darkness was slowly invading the battlefield of the sky.

This scenery was strangely cathartic.

I wonder how many days it will take to experience this tranquil atmosphere
once again.

I absorbed the sweet image into my memory.

I began to walk down that path I had walked down a few times today.

Objects becoming more and more like silhouettes.

I kept walking ahead.

I had to rush ahead to Guo Heng's shop.

I was under the impression that Guo Heng would know what was to be done next.

At night sneaking past the Chang San is bad news.

If anyone sees me like this...

{i}boy, the rumour's won't stop{/i}

You could see the windows of the Brothel had candlelights in some rooms and
electricity in some others.

Grunts and moans also leaked through the window.

God knows how many unloyal men were in there.

I squinter off of the dirt path into the darker edges of the trees shielding
me from the moonlight.

Choice: Peak at who enters and leaves.
Choice: Move on towards Guo's shop

No choice chosen.

Vice
Look at them enjoying themselves.

Vice
Don't {b}you{/b} ever feel the need for that desire?

Vice
Instead you hide and watch other people wear their vices like their skin.

Vice
Pathetic but rewarding.

Vice
Don't keep dreaming.

Vice
It calls you...

Guo Heng's shop is in the distance and he has a few lanterns lit.

I hurriedly sneak over while trying to avoid tripping up on anything.

It was a few minutes away if I had to sneak.

I kept my eyes on the lanterns.

My eyesight could not make out what characters were painted on his lanterns
but they shone bright.

Like the end of a dark hopeless tunnel.

Guo Heng's lantern felt like... {i}hope{/i}.

I keep my breath under control and made sure to keep my feet stable.

Skidding down the bank of dirt I regained my balance and reached Guo Heng's
shop.

Guo Heng signalled something to me using his hands.

Abstraction Compeherension
He's telling you to come over but quietly.

I kept going until I was within talking range.

Guo Heng
"Glad you made it Fang."

Fang Jie
"Same here."

Guo Heng's shop had padlocks on every door and boards nailed into any open
window like entrance as well.

Guo Heng
"It's got to go Fang."

Guo Heng
"It'll probably be blown up by the time I get back but at least my brother
will be safe."

Guo Heng
"Plus I saved up enough in the last 6 months."

Guo heng scans around the lantern lit shop.

I wasn't the only one there.

Guo Heng
"This is Ma-Wen."

Fang Jie
"I know him."

Ma Wen
"Nice to see you again."

Fang Jie
"Same here."

Fang Jie
"you're leaving with us also?"

Ma Wen look into the lunar skies beyond.

Ma Wen
"The monk urged me to go."

Ma Wen
"He said I got a whole life ahead of me."

Ma Wen
"Plus he pretty much kicked me out for that."

Guo Heng had been watching us two talk it out.

Guo Heng
"Good to see we all know each other then."

Guo Heng
"Here's the plan right."

Guo Heng
"Da-Yu is out back with a truck."

Guo Heng
"He does deliveries for my supplies."

Guo Heng
"Bring stuff from as far as Ning-Po to over here in Peiping."

Guo Heng
"It's not his job but he makes a good ammount of money on the side by doing
people favours."

Guo Heng
"His boss hasn't caught him since all his side business stuff is en-route."

Guo Heng
"Anyway Da-Yu says that passengers should chip in their shares depending on
how far we are going to decide to go."

Ma Wen
"I don't give a shit how far we go."

Guo Heng eyes him nervously as his vision darts back to me.

Guo Heng
"What about you Fang?"

Fang Jie
"I'll need to drop off at Tianjin for a quick talk to a friend of mine."

Guo Heng
"You mean he'll come with us?"

Fang Jie
"No, probably not."

Guo Heng
"Why?"

Fang Jie
"He's locked up and in custody."

Guo Heng
"Why do you need to see him then?"

Choice: He's my friend
Choice: I made a promise to someone

No choice chosen.

Guo Heng
"Either way we can't stay there for too long."

Guo Heng
"It will be dawn or ealier when we reach there."

Guo Heng
"You think they'll let you in?"

Fang Jie
"I think they will."

After all my name has been cleared...

After that I have a stop...

Fang Jie
"Tsingtao"

Guo Heng
"Why Tsingtao?"

Fang Jie
"My uncle Ku has a friend there who is indebt to him."

Fang Jie
"I have a written notice from my Uncle to take me in his hospitality while the
war doesn't reach the Shandong province."

Guo Heng
"Depends how fast troops strorm through Hopeh."

Ma Wen
"The Japanese are better than us anyway."

Guo Heng
"Why say that?"

Ma Wen
"Hav you seen the state of our army?"

Ma Wen
"They got to kidnap and chain men to force them to serve."

Ma Wen
"The republic is a fucking failure, that's what."

Ma Wen cynically stated this.

A cigarette would have fit this persona more.

Guo Heng
"What about us two?"

Fang Jie
"I can try to find space for you guys."

Guo Heng
"You would?"

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en is quite influential there."

Fang Jie
"I think he can pull some strings for you guys."

Guo Heng
"I still think we won't be there for very long."

Guo Heng
"Besides I need to get to Guo He in Shanghai."

Ma Wen
"Plus that damn cult of I-Kuan-Tao is there."

Ma Wen
"Doing their weird cult shit and whatever."

Guo Heng
"That too."

Fang Jie
"Well we can get some letters sent to Guo He in Tsingtao."

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en can write something for you anyway."

Guo Heng's face lit up at this.

He seemed elated at this.

Guo Heng then gets up and stretches before walking out to the back where the
truck should be.

Ma Wen
"Moment of truth?"

Fang Jie
"I guess so."

Fang Jie
"Let's go talk to Da-Yu."

I walk ahead into a dimly lit area behind the shop.

Da-Yu
"Tientsin, Tsingtao and Shanghai?"

Da-Yu
"What are you all scouring the coast for?"

Guo Heng
"We all have plans I guess."

Ma Wen
"I just don't want to die in the middle of a shootout."

Da-Yu smirks at Ma Wen.

Da-Yu
"I like how this one speaks."

Guo Heng
"That's Ma Wen."

He points to me.

Guo Heng
"That's Fang."

Da-Yu
"Just Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Just Fang for now."

Da-Yu shook a box of cigarettes and bit down on a roll.

Da-Yu
"Any of you want to try?"

Ma Wen
"Aren't they crazy expensive?"

Da-Yu brought out a foreign imported lighter up to his roll clamped between
his lips.

Flicking the box till it beamed with life.

Da-Yu
"Their expensive cause' they're classy."

Guo Heng have a small nod.

Ma Wen stared at him blankly.

Guo Heng
"How much do we all chip in?"

Da-Yu
"I'm stopping up at Tientsin for a delivery."

Da-Yu
"Your friend here can get off as well but only for 30 minutes."

Da-Yu looked at his pocketwatch in his pocket.

Da-Yu
"Then you all want to go to Tsingtao for a few days."

Da-Yu
"If I drop you all off there then chip in 80 Fabi."

Guo Heng
"That much?"

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this."

Da-Yu points to the truck.

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this{fast} is subsidized by my employers like crazy."

Da-Yu
"Lowest I'm going."

Ma Wen
"I only got 50 on me."

Da-Yu
"Get these two to help you out."

Da-Yu
"If you all went to Shanghai-Nanjing area then boy your wallets would be dry."

Da-Yu
"Anyway time to chip in."

Choice: Pay Ma-Wen's chip
Choice: Let Guo Heng pay for Ma-Wen

No choice chosen.

"Fang"

???
"{cps=*0.4}...{/cps}"

???
"You awake?"

The faint figure was only a silhouette in my half opened eyes.

I had waited so long for him to arrive I had fallen asleep in this god awful
uncomfortable chair.

Choice: I'm awake

No choice chosen.

???
"That's good."

The silhouette moved around a bit more as I tried to gain focus.

???
"It is important you answer these questions properly."

???
"I will go through them one by one."

???
"Alright?"

Choice: ...

No choice chosen.

???
"Do not fret."

Fang Jie
"Yes I understand."

???
"Good."

???
"We're here for you."

???
"Let's get this over with."

That thought was calming to me.

Tough times needed tough people or support.

In this case I knew what {i}I{/i} needed.

I knew I had screwed up...

Protesting and rebelling.

Showing the power of a voice without hope.

Of harsh unfiltered criticism.

What should I expect?

Choice: {i}That was my choice; thus my consequence.{/i}
Choice: {i}Justice being punished is just proof of a unjust leadership.{/i}

No choice chosen.

This gives me a message on autority and power in this country.

It's better to not believe in it too much.

Judgement
Perhaps it is human nature to be self centered.

Judgement
How else is one expected to live in a naturally cruel world?

Choice: By cooperating and becoming strong as a group
Choice: You're right. A litte sefishness is necessary.

No choice chosen.

Judgement
perhaps so.

I should just focus on getting this interview done.

Times are getting intense these days.

We are on the edge of total war - {i}again{/i}.

I began to adjust my eyes and get used to who was around me.

Resting my eyes on the previously known "Silhouette" I recognised him as
"Professor Po-YeurtTarng".

Professor Po Yeutarng is a lawyer who is quite well connected wtih Kuomintang
"Hawks".

"Hawks" in the sense that they perch on your shoulder and are aggressive in
every action they take.

The Professor's very close with my uncle "Ku Hong-Meng".

A scholar who used to work in Peking before he became "enlightened" in a
lifestyle of spiritual content and cosmic toiling.

A full time Taoist in essence.

Professor Po Yeutarng on request of Uncle Ku had come to interview me to clear
of any charges or suspicions with communist acivity.

All three of us knew that I was in no way connected with communists or had any
clear sympathies for them.

The interview still had to be carried out superficially... just to clear my
name.

It was also a good oppurunity to evaluate my situation and possible choices.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Are you Ready Fang?"

Choice: Yes I am Ready.
Choice: Please Give me a minute to think.

No choice chosen.

Focus
"{i}Succeeded in focussing.{/i}"

Fang Jie
"Please give me a minute to think."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"That's fine,"

Normally I would be ready to answer any question coming my way.

I never passed up answering a question.

Beads of sweat formed on my brow.

Summer had just ended so the heat was burning out like some star.

I controlled my air-flow and calmed myself down.

I can do this.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I don't think you did anything wrong."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"You're young."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"You have this burning fire in you that can't be matched."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"You have to vent it out somewhere."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Those hawks will let you go..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"unless they see you have an incentive to believe in communism through traits
such as {i}poverty.{/i}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Which means that any of the other kids that were protesting and weren't
affluent can be suspected more {i}harshly{/i} as "communists" due to their
economic conditions."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I'll have to interview them as well."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I can spot damn communists really well."

Visual Comprehension
I mean you can tell by that patriotic insignia he wears.

Visual Comprehension
Normally he wears a coat to cover it up or keep the coat resting on his
shoulder.

Logic
Why would he hide it?

Visual Comprehension
He's not part of any Kuomintang adminstration based on his job or uniform.

Visual Comprehension
So you can guess why he wears that at all.

Professor Po wore the insignia of the Kuomintang flag on his arm.

It looked well stitched and taken care of.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"You spotted that?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Good eye there."

Visual Comprehension
I know.

Professor Po brushed it lightly.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I do this to preserve Dr Sun's legacy."

Professor Po smirked.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Unlike that "Generalissimo" Chiang."

Professor Po let out a large sigh.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Communists are the {i}worst{/i}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I hoped they would have lost back in Fusze."

Professor Po cursed under his breath as he said this.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well Let us start now."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The hawks want to know more about you this will information will help you
reflect on what you want to do with the looming war."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War's harsh isn't it?"

Professor Po bit his lip and focussed on the blank piece of paper in front of
him.

Fang Jie
"Yeah it is..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Lets start off with being realistic."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Your hometown."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What is your background in terms of location?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I know you and your family have moved places over the years..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's best to choose what is your go-to "home"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Where is it most convenient for you to return home? What would your gut
feeling say?"

Choice: Peiping
Choice: Nanking
Choice: Kwangchow
Choice: Hong-Kong
Choice: Macau
Choice: Taiwan

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Well, the capital is a good place."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Nationalists would fight to the death to keep it safe."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt the Japanese would get that far to Nanking anyway."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt it too. I can't predict how the war will go, but the capital city
will be heavily defended."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Your hometown seem to be out of harms way and strife."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The only issue is that it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"What's wrong with that?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's an international settlement area."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the Opium wars and the onset of unequal treaties an international zone
was established."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's under Kuomintang sovereignty but areas of it are allocated to the
French, British etc."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"While the Japanese don't have any legal right that I'm aware of they have an
"unofficial settelemt" in Kongkew."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's called "Little Tokyo"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"That means Shanghai is the gateway to Chinese territory."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"If you're going to be in Nanking you have to be aware of that."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They might as well just leap frog the legal framework of the Shanghai
International Zone."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War is chaotic and often..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Unpredictable."

Uncle Ku has listened with extreme curisoity.

It seemed this was the first time he had learnt about the legal status of
Shanghai.

Fang Jie
"That's so interesting."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I could be a military strategist with this much analytical skill."

He gave a dry laugh.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Anyway lets get going with the questions."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So what are you doing in Peiping right now?"

Choice: Attending school as a student.
Choice: Working as a scholarly apprentice under my uncle
Choice: Working here to send money back home.
Choice: Taking a break after military conscription training

No choice chosen.

{font=fonts/eng_octin_spraypaint/octin spraypaint a rg.ttf}{color=#4fc1ff}Fang
gained 3 Determination; 3 Intellect and 2 Dexterity!{/color}{/font}

Fang Jie
"I came here to actually continue my education."

Fang Jie
"I am staying with Uncle Ku since it is close to the facilities."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt schools will run under foreign occupation."

Professor Po gave a faint grin.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well classes won't."

Professor Po raised his glass of {i}Máotái{/i} and took a sip.

He normally didn't drink heavily but Uncle Ku had handed him this as a token
of thanks for visiting me.

Giving such an expensive drink symbolised Uncle Ku's gratitude.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most students back in Dongbei would just live at the boarding school."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They would not return to their families."

He raised the cup of {i}Máotái{/i} to his lips but didn't take a sip. {w}As if
something important crossed his mind.{w=1.2}

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the first month a few homesick students did in fact return."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"No vandalism, no abusive powers and the old deposed emperor back on a
throne."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most parents made kids work back on the farms or their old shanty businesses
while the Japanese and {i}Kang-te Pu Yi{/i} tried to get the old ways running
again."

I could make out the sorrow in his face.{nw}

It seemed he made himself remember something he wished to forget.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So I guess you should head back."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I think your family will need you more."

He looked down at his papers as he dipped the brush back into a clay pot of
ink and scribed some details on a creased paper.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What belief system do you follow?"

Choice: Taoism and Confucianism
Choice: Buddhism
Choice: Christianity

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Ah...{w}{cps=*0.9}A fellow buddhist.{/cps}"

Professor Po sipped his {i}Máotái{/i} lightly before facing me.

Bits of his face had manifested a gradient of red.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Have you ever heard of {i}Dhammapada{/i}? {w}{cps=*1.5}the poem of Buddha
awakening?{/cps}"

Choice: Yes

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well that's great!"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"There are so many out there."

Professor Po was beginning to look like he had too much to drink.

Professor Po seemed to increasingly become unable to stay...{w=1.0}sober.

Ku Hong-Meng
"He might need to take some rest."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He grew up around the drink."

Uncle Ku grabbed Professor Po by his arms and mounted him on his back.

Professor Po only slurred some words as Uncle Ku dragged him to a guest room.

I guess{w=1.0} the interview will be conducted later.

I turned my head around to the Taoist Shrine.

It consisted of a {i}Yīnyáng{/i} emblem,{w=0.5} A candle that possessed a
mediocre flame,{w=0.5} and a copy of {i}Tao Te Ch'ing{/i}.

I stood up from the uncomfortable chair and approached the shrine.

It was peaceful to stand before the shrine.

I wasn't required to announce my presence.

Part of me was afraid of the new world I had stepped into.

Will the gods protect me?

Thoughts invaded my mind as I looked at the shrine.

Lúgōuqiáo Shìbiàn had begun only a few days ago.

Uncle Ku ambled out of the guest room with his hands concealed under his
robes.

He grimaced slightly at the situation.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't know what will come out of this."

He seemed to say that calmly.

Something so important...{w=1} taken so lightly.

Fang Jie
"That's fine...{w=1} I can deal with that."

Uncle Ku sat down at the shrine and opened Tao Te Ch'ing.

He was a commited reader and devotee.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go outside and find something to do."

I looked back at Uncle Ku.

He could only sigh.

That was all he could do.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}Don't worry{/cps}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"We can get ut of here in time."

Uncle Ku would reguarly meet in the village centre and talk to elders and
intelectuals about current events.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Japan is mobilising an army, they won't go further than Peiping-Tientsen,
{w=1}I've heard."

Uncle Ku felt hopeless.

Staring into those eyes felt like lies.

Fang Jie
"They keep taking from us."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I know..."

Uncle Ku didn't believe in violence,{w=1.0} he didn't feel the need to fight
back.

I had lost my composure.

I could see Uncle Ku's reaction to me lashing out after such a long time.

Pressure that had built up from everything had finally burst the bottle.

Uncle Ku looked at me solenmly.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}I'm sorry,{w=1} Fang.{/cps}"

Fang Jie
"I'm sorry too."

I turned my back and walked out of the door.

Ku Hong-Meng
"If there is a air raid just run straight to some air raid shelter."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you find a German one, priorotise that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"The German peoples don't get harassed by {i}guizi{/i}."

I had crossed the Er-men.

I kept on walking until I passed through the Da-men.

Outside was a little garden where my Great Grandfather had planted a Sakura
Tree for Sun Yat Sen's new era of the Republic.

It's a real shame I never even learnt his name despite knowing how well known
he was in this local place.

My great grandfather disliked the Qing as they were Manchus as opposed to the
Ming who were a Han Chinese dynasty.

He had a wealthy wine business which gave him the money to buy a large
{i}Siheyuan{/i}

The Sakura was planted to mark the growth a new era without the Qing.

The Sakura plant was also foreign and thus showcased his wealth when he had it
planted.

Everything I ever learnt about him indicated that...{w=1} wealth controlled
his choices.

Sadly he died before he realised how the Republic failed China.

{cps=*0.45}or the shortlived Empire before the warlord era.{/cps}

Beyond the Sakura tree was a pond he had hired workers to build.

Apart from showing off his wealth he would also use this pond to grow Lotuses.

He would grow them in bulks and sell them to Buddhists and Buddhist temples in
which he would get blessed and make money.

now..{w=1} he wasn't shallow that he did that for profit.

He was a devout buddhist.

He would donate large sums of charity to people in need and temples.

I kept walking on until the pond came into view.

Black and white pictures showed budding and blossomed Lotuses on the surface
of the water.

Earlier photos even had swans in them.

What I saw in front of me was neither.

The water was brown, murky and thick.

It was hard to believe anything nice was in there anymore.

Uncle Ku refused to spend his inheritance money on refurbishing things around
the house.

He dared not indulge in materialism and wealth of any kind.

He preferred and carried a metaphorical banner of being a rich man in poor
clothing.

I stared at the pathetic pond.

The pond that gave up on life.

Gave up on struggling.

I turned around fast before facing Lao-Chang.

We called him that because he was an old milkman who didn't want to
retire.{nw}

Hence the name "old Chang".

Fang Jie
"I would agree."

Fang Jie
"That would have been better for the community."

Lao Chang
"We have a groundwater well over on the other side that was dug by Ma Wen's
father."

Lao Chang
"It's near the animals a lot, people are scared that they'll find chicken
shit."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku is a miser wearing the mask of Taoism."

Lao Chang
"That's your opinion."

Lao Chang
"I'm sure if we held a petition he would support it."

Fang Jie
"Really?"

I wasn't sure if that would suspend my disbelief.

Lao Chang
"Calling him a miser won't do him justice."

Lao Chang
"He isn't the kind of person who spends money on themselves."

Lao Chang
"He would rather spend it to support others."

He was old enough to know how everyone functioned in this community.

Fang Jie
"If you ask him, he will."

Lao Chang laughed.

Lao Chang
"You remind me of your grandpa."

Lao Chang sat down on the damp grass next to me that faced the miserable pond.

Fang Jie
"How so?"

Lao Chang
"Whenever there was war...{w=1} the fella just got into a bad mood."

Lao Chang
"During the northern expedition when Chiang Chieh-shih tried to take back from
those warlords.."

Lao Chang
"He had a sulky mood for a week."

Lao Chang dug his hand into the basket tied to his bicycle and took out a rice
snack.

Lao Chang
"You see. {w=1}His sister was back in Kwangchow where this crazy reunifier was
wailing war and unifying cities under his control."

Lao Chang
"He wouldn't get any of her letters from kwangchow so he sulked."

Lao Chang bit into his rice snack and chewed it open mouthed.

Lao Chang
"He sent out a lot of letters to."

Lao Chang
"I wonder where they went."

Lao Chang gazed at the shitty pond. Like it was beautiful as my Great-
Grandfather had left it.

Lao Chang
"Eventually you got this shithole situation where there are so many warlords
and everyone wants to crown a new China."

Lao Chang
"Who do you think will crown a new China?"

Choice: Chiang Chie Shih
Choice: Wang Ching Wei
Choice: Li Tsung-Jen
Choice: Mao Tse-Tung
Choice: I don't know

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think Chiang Chie Shih"

Fang Jie
"He has proclaimed central government."

Fang Jie
"The warlords even cooperate with him."

Fang Jie
"It's more or less if he can centralize power to one form of government."

Lao Chang
"That's a good bet."

Lao Chang
"The national Revolutionary Army rolled over everyone in the Northern
Camapaign."

Lao Chang
"If they keep those troops moralised Dr Sun's democracy will come back to us."

Lao Chang stood up and patted off the back of his pants that had attracted
clumps of damp soil.

Lao Chang
"I gotta get going."

Lao Chang
"Wanna buy a bottle of milk?"

Lao Chang
"You can take it home early."

Fang Jie
"No thanks, I don't have cash."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku will pay for it at the doorstep."

Lao Chang
"I guess that suits it."

Lao Chang grabbed the handles of his makeshift bike and pushed it around.

THe odd thing about Lao Chang was that he would have a bike he would never
ride.

He would just use the basket and push it for ease.

Since he was twice the age of Uncle Ku it made sense.

The bicycle was also too small for him. {w=1}I would have assumed that this
was something thrown away by the child of some wealthy family who grew out of
the bike.

I observed Lao Chang walk off in the distance, pushing his bike and the
flicking the rusted bell that wouldn't make any sound. {w=1}That was because
there was nothing for it to strike against.

I turned and began to walk the other way.

It was a five minute walk away from the village center.

Most young boys or able men would not be welcome there.

This was because young or able men would get kidnapped by the Kuomintang army
and chained and walked down to military headquarters to forcefully enlist.

These days the reports of Kuomintang barging and taking had gone down.

My shoes rubbed in the dirt pass as I ambled on.

In 2 weekss of residing in this district I had started to memorise a map of
the place.

There were a few facilities I was going to walk past.

The most interesting was the brothel.

The sex industry had grown in Manchuria and many boys would talk about it in
the alley ways.

Over here the brothel was something that you should not be seen entering and
leaving if you wanted to have a sense of dignity.

This brothel was known as a {i}Chang San{/i} brothel.

It was like an artistic form of prostituition in which the prositute would
play the lyre, do calligraphy and do paintings.

I think it was a progressive way to humanise prostitutes.

Personally I have never interacted with a prosititute.

Nor do I have a good enough reason to.

I just don't understand their stigma in society.

Many of the girls are of varying ages from 13 to early 40s.

The place was not regulated much with ramapnt bribing and blackmail.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hey Fang!"

I turned to see her sitting in a chair outside the door.

Fang Jie
"Hey"

I did a faint wave.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Is that a wave?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"Relax, {w=1}waving back to me won't make me pounce on you."

She crossed her arms and smiled at me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have my principles."

She grinned.

I didn't know how to respond to her.

All I could give her was an awkward grin.

She giggled at my response.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hard to believe{cps=*0.4}...{/cps}{w=1}Some {i}whore{/i} has a sense of
principle. Right?"

I looked at the ground.

At this point I had trouble making any form of eye contact.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Don't feel bad, little brother."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean, my rules are I don't drink,{w=1} I don't smoke and I don't condone
violence."

She leaned back on her chair against the chipped brick blocks.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have a band of sisters to look after. People in my situation."

I couldn't keep being judged like this.

I felt a need to spit it out.

Fang Jie
"I don't see whatever you're doing as a bad thing."

I interrupted her mid sentence.

She gave a strange look.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Litte brother, if some alleyboy said those words to me, I'd think it's some
ploy for pity lovemaking."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I know my stigma,{cps=*1.2} don't pity me..{/cps}"

She was still in a good mood for some odd reason.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You know, the conflict happening up there doesn't bother me."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If the Japanese do take over, we will just be required to service their
soldiers instead."

She closed her eyes to laugh at herself.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean the industry is booming in Dong-bei, so things around here will change
I guess."

Fang Jie
"Alley boys told you right?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean who else will?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"it's nice talking to a non-pervert for once."

Chang San Brothel worker
"It's amazing how people can have fruitful conversations if you give them a
chance. Right Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Right."

How did she know my name?

Fang Jie
"How do you know my name?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"The other girls you flirt with when they sit outside told me so."

I felt my face go red.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You talk better to the ones your age."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I'm only a few years your senior. {w=1}A solid 19 year old."

Chang San Brothel worker
"You're disappointed. Aren't you?"

She was teasing me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"By the way, my name is Wang Yuelan."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If you ever need shelter, just ask {i}Xiao Wen{/i} to share the room."

She laughed as she opened the door and walked inside.

Rhetorics
She's implying you should use their services if you need shelter.

Rhetorics
After all you will {b}stay the night{/b} there by any way.

Vice
Well would you?

Choice: I don't indulge in such vices.
Choice: Maybe when I'm more "curious".

No choice chosen.

Vice
Vice would be proud to hear "this".

Vice
It's human to have such desires.

Interesting indeed.

They were an interesting bunch,{w=1} strange but interesting.

I kept on walking along the dirt path.

The ambient noises from the brothel faded away with my distance.

I kept walking on.

Each step one by one.

The next facility I would see would be the winery my Great Grandpa owned.

Uncle Ku had sold it when he inherited it from his father.

Uncle Ku didn't want to support himself by destroying the lives of addicts.

At first he kept it out of operation.

It would sit there 5-6 years...{w=1}undisturbed.

Then officials would come and start ordering him to do something productive
with that land and facilities.

After a few months he sold it off to some businessman from Shanghai who wished
to expand their winery business.

Now I walk past it and just look at how many cycles this building has
experienced.

I was never told why this building was built intially, since my Great
Grandfather just decided to occupy this empty place for good business.

His father ran a little business from his home.{w=1}So my Great Grandpa
decided what to do,

He moved all his stuff there and took care of it.

Eventually people began to think this abandoned building didn't host any curse
or haunted by any angry spirits.

Some wealthy people like the Ma family invested in the winery and it grew
bigger.

In about 3 years the bulding had been expanded to four times its intial size.

Over 70 people worked here for good pay.

My Great Grandpa built an expensive Siheyuan and began to live lavishly like
the Ma family.

He died believing resourcefulness and willpower outperforms fate.

I would get told all about this from the locals like Lao Chang or Ah-Mei the
educated daughter of a noble family residing here.

Eventually passing the collosal winery I began to see the village centre in
sight.

It wasn't a centre where you would assume it was a meeting spot.

It was a noodle shop run by the Guo family.

Everyone would come and eat there once in a while and that became the de-facto
village centre.

It was run by two brothers around my age.

The older was Guo Heng, who took over the shop when his father passed away
from a stroke two years ago.

He raised his younger brother to learn to cook as well.

Eventually they got their skills developed and Guo Heng got to send his
brother "Guo He" to school.

I have met Guo Heng only a few times,{w=0.5} but he is very interesting to
talk to.

He has developed a passion for making all kinds of noodles.

Last time I visited him he showed me his father's recipe that had been handed
down for god knows how long.

He offered to employ me to his noodle shop if I ever needed a place to work.

Despite being 23 years old Guo Heng was arguably graying from his stress.{w=1}
Something he always loved joking about with the other villagers.

The noodle shop even had a banner which would ostentaciously show off its
wealth and success.

In short, if there was any celebration, meeting, or festival, Guo's noodle
shop was the place.

Mostly because it was the most central and most convenint for everyone to meet
at.

I passed through and entered the store.

Guo Heng had sat on a table and was appying a dirty rag to wipe the sweat off
his face.

The summer sun was strong and it didn't help he cooked behind a fire all day.

Guo Heng seemed to age faster everytime I visited him.

His body had become more built and skinny while his face became browner with
more wrinkles.

His hair had remained the same, {w=1}Little whisks of grey popping out once in
an occassional spot.

Guo Heng looked up at me with his brown eyes that resembled foreign
manufactured chocolate.

Guo Heng
"Fang!{w=1}{nw}"

I sat down opposite on the same table he was sitting at.

Fang Jie
"Hey, Heng"

It was midday and the sun was now forcing its heated will on us like spears.

At the highest point in the sky, a false inferno had formed.

Fang Jie
"You must hate the sun so much if you go through this everyday."

Guo Heng gave a smirk and dabbed his white dirtied rag on his face.

His shirt had wet patches near his armpits and chest.

Guo Heng
"I think its fair."

Fang Jie
"How is this fair?"

Guo Heng was quite wise because the elders would gather here and include him
in philosophical talks.

Guo Heng
"There are two things in this world which are fair."

Guo Heng
"THese two things never judge...{w=1}never discriminate."

He dabbed the cloth on his face again.

Guo Heng
"The first is death. In this world God and the Devil may judge you, but death
will come for you, no matter how good,{w=1}how bad, or whatever you are."

Guo Heng
"Death doesn't pick favourites."

Guo Heng
"The Second is the sun."

Guo Heng
"For Aeons the Sun had given light regardless of the morality of the creature
receiving it."

Guo Heng
"The sun when it's too hot will feel this way to everyone."

Guo Heng
"If the sun isn't judging than whatever the sun does,{w=1}is fair."

Fang Jie
"You really learn some interesting stuff from those elders."

Guo Heng
"I know right."

Guo Heng
"They don't have anything to do, so i give them discounted noodles and educate
myself."

I looked up at the sky

It was clear and cloudless.

Fang Jie
"Don't you get worried about the Japanese?"

Heng looked up to the sky.

Guo Heng
"I heard they're readying air raid shelters because the Japanese are mobilsing
for a full attack."

Guo Heng
"Maybe I'll have to learn to cook Ramen."

Fang Jie
"What about your younger brother?"

Guo Heng
"I'm planning to send him to Nanking where he will be safer."

Heng dabbed the cloth on his face again.

His hair had beads of sweat bouncing but never dropping off.

Fang Jie
"Really?"

Guo Heng
"It's a good idea to evacuate before they start fighting."

Guo Heng
"Ma Wen told me that the Shanghai International Zone would become a passage of
entrance for the Japanese."

Guo Heng
"He advised me not to send Guo He to Shanghai."

Guo Heng
"Hence I chose Nanking."

Guo Heng
"The Japanese would probably confiscate the shop and make me do work without
profit."

Fang Jie
"That is true."

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Guo Heng
"The capital itself."

Guo Heng
"What is it like there?"

Guo Heng applied the rag to his sweaty face again.

Fang Jie
"Nanking in it's name means "Southern Capital"."

Fang Jie
"The first time it ruled a united China was in the Ming Dynasty."

Fang Jie
"It's a nice place to live overall."

Fang Jie
"It has a powerful inland port and it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"If you're rich then you're like a foreigner.{w=1} You dress pretty or look
handsome."

Fang Jie
"There's a lot of people there and you even have western Churches propped up
in some places of the city."

Fang Jie
"Due to these churches, chinese children of Christian believers learn English
well and proficiently."

Guo Heng looked at me bewildered.

Guo Heng
"Can you speak English?"

He looked so excited for some reason.

Fang Jie
"A bit,{w=1} I can communicate a good amount with some American residents."

Guo Heng
"What other kind sof foreigners are there in Nanking?"

I sat back and thought a little.

Fang Jie
"You have German businessmen from the German Reich with their families that
settle her to manage German businesses in China."

Fang Jie
"Some German military officiers also train Chinese troops, like General
Alexander von Falkenhausen."

Fang Jie
"He is the military advisor to Chiang Chieh-Shih for their joint military
reform program."

Fang Jie
"You have Japanese people too, who initially settled in the Japanese sector of
Shanghai and moved to Nanking but you don't see them around too often."

Fang Jie
"Other europeans are rare to see, apart from some British who do business with
Americans."

Guo Heng
"I guess Nanking is becoming a global city."

Fang Jie
"I'd say the same thing."

Guo Heng
"At least foreigners are cooperating rather than invading us.{w=1} Apart from
Japan."

Guo Heng cursed under his breath.

He dabbed the rag once again.

Guo Heng
"Is there anything special in the capital city of the republic?"

Fang Jie
"There is a statue of Chiang Chieh-Shih in the middle of the city."

Guo Heng
"What about Dr Sun?"

Fang Jie
"He doesn't need a statue."

Fang Jie
"He has a big Mausoleum called "Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum" which I think gives his
legacy justice."

Guo Heng
"What's in the Mausoleum now?"

Fang Jie
"A marble sarcophagus."

Fang Jie
"and a ceiling with the Kuomintang sun stretching above."

Guo Heng
"How's house arrest been?"

Fang Jie
"It's been fine."

Fang Jie
"I've managed to learn more about my "ancestral land"."

Fang Jie
"Sadly I can't stay here for long."

Guo Heng
"Why so?"

Fang Jie
"There's a war going to start."

Guo Heng
"I guess that makes sense."

There was nothing to say.

It was a bit awkward but it was difficult to articulate conversation.

I don't have in the slightest an idea of what to do.

Choice: Keep conversing with Guo Heng.
Choice: Take leave

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think its time I get moving."

Fang Jie
"I have a pending interview to undergo."

Fang Jie
"He should be coming to conduct it soon."

Guo Heng rubbed the rag on his face.

Guo Heng
"I have to work anyway."

Guo Heng
"It was nice to talk with you Fang."

Guo Heng stood up.

Guo Heng put down his sweat rag.

The sun was piercing through his thin ragged shirt.

You could see how the sweat now made the shirt a paint to his canvas of a
skin.

Guo Heng
"No offense Fang,"

Guo Heng
"I have work now."

Guo Heng
"I can't afford always taking a break."

Guo Heng
"It takes time to make preparations for a meal."

Guo Heng stood up.

I grinned at him as well.

It was pleasant.

Guo Heng was now slaving away in his kitchen once again.

I stood up and walked outside and began to think.

Visiting the village temple was an opportunity to calm myself down and think
about life.

I'd often get to sit and think.

It was almost as quite as the libraries in Peking University.

The temple wasn't far from Guo's noddle shop.

I began to amble to my destination.

The temple had been around since the inception of the village.

It was the oldest unchanged object in this whole place.

It is rumored that the village was built by rich landowning elites in the Ming
dynasty.

It would make sense to see why this village is prosperous more than most.

Apart from that there is also a gilded reputation of this place.

It is prosperous but on the backs of laborers and rural wanderers or military
deserters.

People like {i}Ma Shih{/i} often hired these desperate people for cheap and
made them do things well beyond their pay.

It's no rumor that a few times a month the newly hired workers on his farm are
either hospitalized or were seen running away.

Lao Chang used to work for Ma Shih's father who was a complete opposite in
fact.

Lao Chang deifies that man because of him Lao Chang had a place to stay and
never felt an empty stomach for 15 or so years.

Then he died and his cheap cruel son took over the farm and made it much more
sinister.

Its a thought that keeps me up at night.

Maybe it's why these poor dis-empowered people turn to communism.

After all why defend something that oppresses you?

As I keep walking, other thoughts amble into my mind.



I knelt down and kept my eyes closed.

I was so calm I could hear my own heartbeat.

Monk
"How are you feeling?"

I opened my eyes once more.

Monk
"You seem much more calm than when you entered this place."

A monk wearing the orange robes was standing in front of me with a gentle
smile.

Monk
"I'm glad to see that."

The monk turns around and orders a temple worker something in a foreign
language.

Monk
"Don't take offense to that."

Monk
"I speak in my dialect."

Monk
"I just told him to bring you some water."

Monk
"This temple is just as much of a house for me and him."

Monk
"That's why all visitors are treated as guests."

Monk
"I would just like to request we do not entertain ourselves to discussion
here."

Monk
"It's a place of worship."

Fang Jie
"Ah.. Sure."

Monk
"Thanks for understanding."

I follow the Monk into a small room.

Monk
"This place was donated to by Ma-Shih."

Monk
"I'm happy that he is so generous to us."

Monk
"That man I asked to get water for you used to work for Ma-Shih."

Monk
"He took refuge here 2 winters ago."

Monk
"Ma-Shih fearing for his existence gave colossal donations to the temple as a
result."

Monk
"I wonder if such acts bear one fruit."

Monk
"What would you think?"

Choice: People fear ruining their eternal afterlife.
Choice: People are naturally selfish.
Choice: In the end it doesn't matter, it's better to live nicer when alive.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"People do the wrong thing and try to make up for it."

Fang Jie
"I feel they don't realize it's better to just avoid doing the wrong thing."

Monk
"Of course, I would agree with that."

Monk
"Yet I could argue that the money from Ma-Shih to the temple allows that man
to live safely and comfortably."

Monk
"Such thoughts shouldn't plague ones mind."

Monk
"Allowing things to be carried on your shoulders mentally is what creates the
burden and worrying we want to run away from."

Monk
"I don't know your story."

Monk
"I don't know why you came in here looking so upset before your "prayer"."

Monk
"I'm glad you have subdued your frustrations."

Monk
"but you must learn to control them at will."

The temple servant strolled in with a glass of water.

I assume they had to use the temple well to get the water which would explain
the wait.

Monk
"Do you recognize him?"

I looked over at the fresh face of the temple servant.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid not."

Monk
"He is Ma-Wen. The son of Ma-Shih."

Ma Wen
"Namaste."

He did a slight bow as he did this.

Ma Wen
"Have some water to drink."

Fang Jie
"Sure.. Thank you."

Ma Wen
"You're welcome."

I picked up the glass of water and drank it down to drown my sense of
surprise.

Ma Wen
"Don't drink so fast."

Ma Wen took a seat on the same bench as the Monk.

Ma Wen
"It's true, I am Ma-Shih's son."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: Why did you of all people run away?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: What about the rest of your family?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"My mother died a few winters back."

Ma Wen
"The only place I see her are in my dreams."

Ma Wen
"I feel like it's punishment for not mourning her death for three years."

Ma Wen
"That was my responsibility as her son."

Ma Wen
"As for my siblings..."

Ma Wen
"They can go their own way."

Ma Wen
"They'll soon realize how toxic their "Oh so precious father" is."

Ma Wen
"I know they'll do that."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: Why did you of all people run away?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: What happened to your mother?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"I don't want to talk about it."

Ma Wen
"It's personal."

Choice: I'm sorry
Choice: ...

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm sorry."

Ma Wen didn't budge from my offense.

Ma Wen
"Forget it."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: Why did you of all people run away?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Just because I lived lavishly and didn't have to struggle for anything did
not mean I wanted to live with some narcissist."

Ma Wen
"His attitude, behavior, constant escaping of laborers."

Ma Wen
"It builds up in your head."

Ma Wen
"In defiance of his controlling personality I just walked out."

Ma Wen
"Sometimes it's that simple to send a message to someone that dense."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Didn't you hear what I said?"

Ma Wen
"Money doesn't feel nice when there's a narcissist pissing you off every
second."

Ma Wen
"Pay more attention when I'm talking."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Yeah."

Ma Wen
"I probably won't get an inheritance either."

Ma Wen
"Nothing to return to."

Ma Wen
"So I'm going to try and live a good life wherever I may be."

Monk
"Quite the story."

Monk
"I don't judge people so I took him in."

Monk
"Different lives don't matter as long there is mutual respect."

Monk
"When he came here, he was just like you."

Monk
"Everyone has a struggle."

Monk
"Listening to others will ease that feeling that no-one understands your
burdens."

Monk
"Stories are a window to empathy."

Ma Wen sat there unmoving.

He seemed eerily... stolid.

Monk
"I'm here to talk if you want."

Monk
"What about you Ma-Wen?"

Ma Wen looks up from the floor.

Ma Wen
"I shoud attend to some duties."

Monk
"I guess that's alright."

Ma Wen abruptly stands up and leaves the room.

I could hear his heavy rapid footsteps hit the wooden floors until he stormed
into the next room.

I didn't realise I had angered him so much.

Fang Jie
"I should have also paid attention I guess."

Fang Jie
"He was talking about something personal and I kept digging the wrong places."

Monk
"Don't overthink it."

Monk
"It will take time for him to come to terms with these feelings."

Monk
"Self hate is a poison in which time is its antidote."

Fang Jie
"I guess I can agree with that."

The Monk retreats back into his mind to think for a moment.

Monk
"You've only been around here for two weeks right?"

Fang Jie
"Yes, that's right."

Monk
"Why are you here?"

Fang Jie
"There's too many reasons for that."

Monk
"Will you walk South?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not sure about that."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to drop everything and run."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to get caught in crossfire."

Fang Jie
"Or enslaved by the army."

Monk
"All fair crticisms."

Monk
"I can't disagree with that."

Monk
"Have you talked to Ku Hsien-Sheng?"

Fang Jie
"No I have not yet..."

Monk
"I have a good feeling about you."

Monk
"I feel the same way about Ma-Wen."

Monk
"I won't be moving an inch from here."

Monk
"That is my personal choice."

Monk
"You..."

The monk looked at the ground for a second.

Monk
"You're young."

Monk
"You don't deserve to get invovled in this."

Monk
"You have a whole life ahead of you."

Monk
"Every choice you make counts."

Monk
"If you don't mind can you help me out with some serivce preparations?"

Monk
"It will be best to give Ma-Wen a rest for today."

I stand up and thank the Monk for his hospitality.

He doesn't reply but retort with a smile.

I walk past the rooms and the deity room to the outside wind.

The wind was gentle and inviting as I stood and absorbed it's chilled
sensations.



I seemed to have a lot of work left.

Normally I would be in the urban districts of Peiping where you could see
people from all places gather.

Even the Japanese across the Marco-Polo Bridge.

I would attend Peiping university so I could work abroad.

Strangely my dreams seem to force me to run away from my current situation.

I begin to walk back home as my books are there.

How would I confront Uncle Ku?

I felt like I has strained things again.

Part of me always does this.

Part of me always blames me for blaming myself for things outside of my
control.

I realize I always dwell on such trivial matters.

It's strange really.

I guess this walk didn't get me anything.

I felt my leather shoes grind the dust as I ambled.

Is my education even a priority?

{i}I should be evacuating... right?{/i}

The Chang San Brothel was now in view again.

Chang San was not even its name, it was just a type of brothel.

I never bothered asking the name anyway.

Was it important to know its name?

I began to speed-walk at this rate.

The wine factory that was supposed to be starting up soon will now be left
decrepit.

I wonder what the soldiers would do to it when they occupy it.

Yue-Lan has already expressed what the soldiers would do with the brothel
under occupation.

It didn't strike me as surprising in any sense.

They would probably start up the factory with some volunteers and drink till
they drop.

I kept on walking for what felt like 10 minutes until the pathetic pond came
back into view.

The pond in my eyes resembled an animal that was wounded and in pain.

Like it needed to be put out of its misery.

It would also be a breeding ground for ill stuff.

The water is brown and god knows that is swimming in there.

I gaze away and walk back in through the Da-men.

I couldn't hear Uncle Ku doing anything at the alter.

I wonder if he is home.

I have to find my books and start reading.

I chose courses in law at Peking university.

I seemed to have a strong sense of civil justice since I was young.

When you're a kid and you feel like the leadership has failed you then you
grow up wanting that to change.

Perhaps my determination to change a faulty system came from a hatred of its
failures.

I can't even understand my own intentions for such ambitions but I persist.

I reject the alternate options.

I dragged a book off of the shelf and put it on my table.

One day I wish I could become part of this system and hopefully steer it
towards a path for the better.

Time to study.

I recited the final quotes and notes to cement them in my head.

Studying like this has helped me become more calm.

It's all I have these days.

Working towards more work.

{i}I'm such a workaholic{/i}

Uncle Ku still hasn't come back even despite the fact I had studied to just
above an hour.

I wonder if he was called to a meeting.

Surely I would meet them on the way to Guo's shop.

Perhaps he was talking with some workers on building air raid shelters.

Uncle Ku is well connected with people in high places, perhaps an officer
informed him to undertake responsibility to dig air raid shelters.

After all they might start bombing any day soon when they're mobilized.

The thought of war...

It still haunts me.

Will people be able to keep their sanity after witnessing near death,
bloodshed and regular bombing?

In all honesty I have doubts on my capacity to handle the terrors of war.

I'm not some mythological hero who can fight till their last breath.

I just didn't want to be involved in this.

{i}Is that why I want to run away?{/i}

{i}If Uncle Ku and Professor Po realized this then this support for escaping
further south makes sense.{/i}

Beijing may be the resident of my ancestors but I have to face reality.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang?"

I sat up not expecting him to enter the house so silently.

Ku Hong-Meng
"What are you hung up about?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The hawks?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The communist accusations?"

Uncle Ku sat in silence for a few seconds before manifesting an idea.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're hung up on Li aren't you?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not."

Fang Jie
"It does make me guilty."

Fang Jie
"But what can I do?"

Fang Jie
"If he was in my place he wouldn't be doing anything for me either."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm not here to pinpoint whose fault it is that Li is in prison."

Fang Jie
"I know."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Did you even visit him?"

Fang Jie
"I don't want to raise suspicions that I really am in kahoots with treasonous
activity."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He was your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Could you do that to a friend?"

Fang Jie
"Would I want to put my life in danger further?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"And let him suffer?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're going to make him grow to hate you."

Fang Jie
"My hands are tied."

Fang Jie
"What can I do?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The professor has already left."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He said the questions he asked what enough to write a statement on you that
could get you out."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I guess you're out of the trouble now aren't you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Maybe do something similar for your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Don't throw your friend into a hole."

Choice: Don't worry. I know the right thing to do.
Choice: There are bigger things to worry about right now.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I won't stab him in the back like that."

Fang Jie
"I'll try and help him out when I have time."

Uncle Ku gave a pleasant smile upon hearing this.

By the way...

Fang Jie
"I've been thinking about it."

Fang Jie
"We should walk south far away from the conflict."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you crazy?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Why would you want to do that?"

Fang Jie
"To stay safe!"

Fang Jie
"Why else would I want to escape a bloodbath?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You are telling me that I should leave my land like food on a platter for
some invaders?"

Fang Jie
"If it means that we will live for another sunrise.."

Fang Jie
"then YES!"

Uncle Ku had a look of disbelief painted on his face.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you out of your mind?"

How the hell should I approach this?

Choice: They aren't like how they were in Manchuria.
Choice: Listen to yourself!

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"Do you honestly in your own right mind think that standing upright while they
carry guns will change anything?"

Fang Jie
"It may be nihilistic but"

Fang Jie
"In this scenario it's realistic."

Fang Jie
"We have to make concrete decisions now."

Choice: I'm leaving for South whether you like it or not
Choice: It will be better if you could come.

No choice chosen.

Choice: I'm leaving for South whether you like it or not
Choice: It will be better if you could come.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid I will have to go to Nanking."

Fang Jie
"I know this might be harsh but I don't want to leave you behind at all
costs."

Fang Jie
"That is why I need you to come with me."

Fang Jie
"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there some friend in Qingdao you can
contact?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I accept your goodwill and honest intentions for my safety."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I also have some disagreements."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You got accepted into Peking university."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You joined a protest about things that matter to you and to you only."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Now you are forcing my own hand to your will."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you noticed how self-entitled you are?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You've only been here two weeks and I'm starting to see a controlling trait
of yours emerging."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang you don't need to be {i}this{/i} rash."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm sorry."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I may be that old traditional thinking fundamentalist."

Ku Hong-Meng
"But my choices will remain my choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You can leave."

Uncle Ku sat on the guest bed.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any hard feelings from what is a natural response to fear and
danger."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Out of goodwill I can help prepare you."

Choice: Thank you.

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep your admission papers with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Peking university might move during wartime like any other kind of business."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Even after the war when it returns it will be nice to have your spot
guaranteed."

Uncle Ku scratched his head as he thought.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you still have the work recommendation letter from Cheung?"

Rhetorics
A rhetorical question.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep that with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you could find some kind hearted foreigner to work for then most of your
tantrums will go silent."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go to Tsingtao."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Over there I have an academic colleague by the name of Wang P'u Ch'en"

Ku Hong-Meng
"He's quite rich. Rich as me I would say."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He has a wife who is referred to as "Lady Wang"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Her full name is Wang Yue Hsiang but don't ever refer to her with that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I will write a letter to him explaining him to take you in for as long as you
need to be dependent on him or leave further south."

Ku Hong-Meng
"After all he owes me."

Choice: Why?

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I sponsored his education and accommodation with my house and inherited
wealth."

Ku Hong-Meng
"His success today is due to my input."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Since he owes me he can't turn you away."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt he would have turned you away even if he didn't owe me."

Ku Hong-Meng
"This sort of goodwill comes in handy down the line you see."

Uncle Ku kept on dabbing the brush in ink and sliding it elegantly across a
piece of paper approximately the size of a table-top world map.

Ku Hong-Meng
"By the way Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you heard of {i}I Kuan-Tao{/i}?"

Choice: Yes

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Good."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is actually studying about the sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I need to tell you two things in regards to it."

Ku Hong-Meng
"First you need to stay away from that sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"By that I mean don't believe in what they tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Besides you might get sucked into more obscure and shadowy organizations."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Secondly if you can help Wang P'u Ch'en gain insight into the organization
then you can prolong your stay with him indefinitely by paying him with
"intel"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Provided you don't fall victim to their lies."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is eying them carefully."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I put down in this letter than you might be willing to help him out on
learning about it in exchange for living space."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When you reach there make your own choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Here you go."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I forgot to tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Professor Po will stay in contact also."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He'll use his connections to help you out if you need help."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Just keep track of how much you {i}owe{/i} him."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Let me walk you off tonight."

Ku Hong-Meng
"God knows what will come out of this war."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When the war ends feel free to come back here."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Or go wherever else you want."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'll keep sending letters to you in Tsingtao unless the Japanese begin
intercepting them."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you do decide to go further south then inform me so that I can keep in
contact."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you have a torch or anything?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's pretty dark out there."

Choice: No

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any lanterns around."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Will you be able to make it still?"

Fang Jie
"Sure, I can."

Fang Jie
"Thanks for everything."

Uncle Ku gave a faint smile.

Something you don't normally expect from him.

It was nice I guess to be sent of with a smile.

even if I did speak to him like that.

I hope it didn't leave any hard feelings.

Fang Jie
"Time to meet Guo Heng again."

I might have to make a choice on a whim tonight.

I could plan it out with Guo Heng and quickly pack to go on ahead.

I would still need to talk to Uncle Ku about this.

I should try to make him leave with us to Tsingtao for the timebeing.

Then we can make more long term decisions about how to go up against the war.

Besides with Uncle Ku on our side the financial aspect of the group will be
fixed.

By now the sun was setting.

Darkness was slowly invading the battlefield of the sky.

This scenery was strangely cathartic.

I wonder how many days it will take to experience this tranquil atmosphere
once again.

I absorbed the sweet image into my memory.

I began to walk down that path I had walked down a few times today.

Objects becoming more and more like silhouettes.

I kept walking ahead.

I had to rush ahead to Guo Heng's shop.

I was under the impression that Guo Heng would know what was to be done next.

At night sneaking past the Chang San is bad news.

If anyone sees me like this...

{i}boy, the rumour's won't stop{/i}

You could see the windows of the Brothel had candlelights in some rooms and
electricity in some others.

Grunts and moans also leaked through the window.

God knows how many unloyal men were in there.

I squinter off of the dirt path into the darker edges of the trees shielding
me from the moonlight.

Choice: Peak at who enters and leaves.
Choice: Move on towards Guo's shop

No choice chosen.

Vice
Look at them enjoying themselves.

Vice
Don't {b}you{/b} ever feel the need for that desire?

Vice
Instead you hide and watch other people wear their vices like their skin.

Vice
Pathetic but rewarding.

Vice
Don't keep dreaming.

Vice
It calls you...

Guo Heng's shop is in the distance and he has a few lanterns lit.

I hurriedly sneak over while trying to avoid tripping up on anything.

It was a few minutes away if I had to sneak.

I kept my eyes on the lanterns.

My eyesight could not make out what characters were painted on his lanterns
but they shone bright.

Like the end of a dark hopeless tunnel.

Guo Heng's lantern felt like... {i}hope{/i}.

I keep my breath under control and made sure to keep my feet stable.

Skidding down the bank of dirt I regained my balance and reached Guo Heng's
shop.

Guo Heng signalled something to me using his hands.

Abstraction Compeherension
He's telling you to come over but quietly.

I kept going until I was within talking range.

Guo Heng
"Glad you made it Fang."

Fang Jie
"Same here."

Guo Heng's shop had padlocks on every door and boards nailed into any open
window like entrance as well.

Guo Heng
"It's got to go Fang."

Guo Heng
"It'll probably be blown up by the time I get back but at least my brother
will be safe."

Guo Heng
"Plus I saved up enough in the last 6 months."

Guo heng scans around the lantern lit shop.

I wasn't the only one there.

Guo Heng
"This is Ma-Wen."

Fang Jie
"I know him."

Ma Wen
"Oh I know this guy alright."

Ma Wen sarcastically imitiates me.

Ma Wen
"Same guy that couldn't listen straight."

Ma Wen
"Same guy that will accompany us away from this place?"

Ma Wen
"Is this guy going to also ask us about our dead loved ones along the way?"

Guo Heng
"Wen you need to calm down."

Fang Jie
"What happened between you and Fang?"

Choice: I made some mistakes
Choice: ...

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Sure you did."

Ma Wen
"Just get this straight."

Guo Heng
"Jeez stop Wen!"

Ma Wen looked Guo Heng vehemently.

He turned his gaze back to me.

Ma Wen
"We got issues."

Ma Wen
"and... I'll hold them against you."

Fang Jie
"you're leaving with us also?"

Ma Wen look into the lunar skies beyond.

Ma Wen
"The monk urged me to go."

Ma Wen
"He said I got a whole life ahead of me."

Ma Wen
"Plus he pretty much kicked me out for that."

Guo Heng had been watching us two talk it out.

Guo Heng
"Some history between you two."

Guo Heng
"Here's the plan right."

Guo Heng
"Da-Yu is out back with a truck."

Guo Heng
"He does deliveries for my supplies."

Guo Heng
"Bring stuff from as far as Ning-Po to over here in Peiping."

Guo Heng
"It's not his job but he makes a good ammount of money on the side by doing
people favours."

Guo Heng
"His boss hasn't caught him since all his side business stuff is en-route."

Guo Heng
"Anyway Da-Yu says that passengers should chip in their shares depending on
how far we are going to decide to go."

Ma Wen
"I don't give a shit how far we go."

Guo Heng eyes him nervously as his vision darts back to me.

Guo Heng
"What about you Fang?"

Fang Jie
"I'll need to drop off at Tianjin for a quick talk to a friend of mine."

Guo Heng
"You mean he'll come with us?"

Fang Jie
"No, probably not."

Guo Heng
"Why?"

Fang Jie
"He's locked up and in custody."

Guo Heng
"Why do you need to see him then?"

Choice: He's my friend
Choice: I made a promise to someone

No choice chosen.

Guo Heng
"Either way we can't stay there for too long."

Guo Heng
"It will be dawn or ealier when we reach there."

Guo Heng
"You think they'll let you in?"

Ma Wen
"Why the fuck do we got to play by his tunes?"

Guo Heng
"Cause you don't have any tunes."

Guo Heng
"{i}"I don't give a shit how far we go"{/i}"

Ma Wen went quiet on this.

Fang Jie
"Back to the topic..."

Fang Jie
"I think they will."

After all my name has been cleared...

After that I have a stop...

Fang Jie
"Tsingtao"

Guo Heng
"Why Tsingtao?"

Fang Jie
"My uncle Ku has a friend there who is indebt to him."

Fang Jie
"I have a written notice from my Uncle to take me in his hospitality while the
war doesn't reach the Shandong province."

Guo Heng
"Depends how fast troops strorm through Hopeh."

Ma Wen
"The Japanese are better than us anyway."

Guo Heng
"Why say that?"

Ma Wen
"Hav you seen the state of our army?"

Ma Wen
"They got to kidnap and chain men to force them to serve."

Ma Wen
"The republic is a fucking failure, that's what."

Ma Wen cynically stated this.

A cigarette would have fit this persona more.

Guo Heng
"What about us two?"

Ma Wen
"He's going to abandon us."

Ma Wen
"Big guy here has his rich uncle take care of everything for him."

Ma Wen
"Not a worry in the world for us two right?"

Guo Heng began to look visibly annoyed at this rate.

Guo Heng
"Wen, can you just shut up for a moment."

Fang Jie
"I can try to find space for you guys."

Guo Heng
"You would?"

Ma Wen
"Lip service shit."

Ma Wen
"Like hell you'll find us someplace to stay."

Guo Heng clenched his fist and breathed in deeply.

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en is quite influential there."

Fang Jie
"I think he can pull some strings for you guys."

Guo Heng
"I still think we won't be there for very long."

Guo Heng
"Besides I need to get to Guo He in Shanghai."

Ma Wen
"Plus that damn cult of I-Kuan-Tao is there."

Ma Wen
"Doing their weird cult shit and whatever."

Guo Heng
"That too."

Fang Jie
"Well we can get some letters sent to Guo He in Tsingtao."

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en can write something for you anyway."

Guo Heng's face lit up at this.

He seemed elated at this.

Ma Wen
"Don't think I'll forgive you over this kind shit."

GUo Heng had already left around back for Da-Yu's truck.

I'm imagening how annoyed Ma Wen's toxic mood had made him feel.

Fang Jie
"Let's just get to the damn truck at least."

Ma Wen gives a heavy sigh and follows me to the truck.

I walk ahead into a dimly lit area behind the shop.

Da-Yu
"Tientsin, Tsingtao and Shanghai?"

Da-Yu
"What are you all scouring the coast for?"

Guo Heng
"We all have plans I guess."

Ma Wen
"I just don't want to die in the middle of a shootout."

Da-Yu smirks at Ma Wen.

Da-Yu
"I like how this one speaks."

Guo Heng
"Sure you will."

It was too dark to see but I bet Guo Heng rolled his eyes.

Guo Heng
"That's Ma Wen."

He points to me.

Guo Heng
"That's Fang."

Da-Yu
"Just Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Just Fang for now."

Da-Yu shook a box of cigarettes and bit down on a roll.

Da-Yu
"Any of you want to try?"

Ma Wen
"Aren't they crazy expensive?"

Da-Yu brought out a foreign imported lighter up to his roll clamped between
his lips.

Flicking the box till it beamed with life.

Da-Yu
"They're expensive cause' they're classy."

Guo Heng have a small nod.

Ma Wen stared at him blankly.

Guo Heng
"How much do we all chip in?"

Da-Yu
"I'm stopping up at Tientsin for a delivery."

Da-Yu
"Your friend here can get off as well but only for 30 minutes."

Da-Yu looked at his pocketwatch in his pocket.

Da-Yu
"Then you all want to go to Tsingtao for a few days."

Da-Yu
"If I drop you all off there then chip in 80 Fabi."

Guo Heng
"That much?"

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this."

Da-Yu points to the truck.

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this{fast} is subsidized by my employers like crazy."

Da-Yu
"Lowest I'm going."

Ma Wen
"I only got 50 on me."

Da-Yu
"Get these two to help you out."

Da-Yu
"If you all went to Shanghai-Nanjing area then boy your wallets would be dry."

Da-Yu
"Anyway time to chip in."

Choice: Pay Ma-Wen's chip
Choice: Let Guo Heng pay for Ma-Wen

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I can."

Ma Wen
"Really?"

Fang Jie
"Sure, why not?"

Ma Wen
"Ma Wen looked glumly before Da-Yu took the bill into his hand."

Da-Yu
"Well that settles it."

Da-Yu
"Congrats on a chance at new life."

He opens the door and hops in.

Da-Yu
"I envy you guys."

Guo Heng
"Why?"

Da-Yu
"You get to feel the cool breeze and open air space around it."

Ma Wen
"We're going to be in the back?"

Da-Yu
"It's not that bad."

Da-Yu
"Like I said.. I really do envy you."

Da-Yu
"When I start this thing up give this place a formal farewell."

Da-Yu
"Who knows what will happen to it or you."

What a depressing thought.

I walk around to the back with Guo Heng and Ma Wen.

It's dark and full of stock.

Guo Heng
"Get on Fang."

Ma Wen still looked pissed.

He just stared me down from atop of the open backdoor of the truck.

I grab the cold bars at the side of the back and hop on.

Guo Heng
"Surreal?"

Fang Jie
"Yeah"

Ma Wen just lies against the wall of the truck and stares up at the black
roof.

"{cps=*0.4}...{/cps}"

"You awake?"

The faint figure was only a silhouette in my half opened eyes.

I had waited so long for him to arrive I had fallen asleep in this god awful
uncomfortable chair.

Choice: I'm awake

No choice chosen.

???
"That's good."

The silhouette moved around a bit more as I tried to gain focus.

???
"It is important you answer these questions properly."

???
"I will go through them one by one."

???
"Alright?"

Choice: ...

No choice chosen.

???
"Do not fret."

Fang Jie
"Yes I understand."

???
"Good."

???
"We're here for you."

???
"Let's get this over with."

That thought was calming to me.

Tough times needed tough people or support.

In this case I knew what {i}I{/i} needed.

I knew I had screwed up...

Protesting and rebelling.

Showing the power of a voice without hope.

Of harsh unfiltered criticism.

What should I expect?

Choice: {i}That was my choice; thus my consequence.{/i}
Choice: {i}Justice being punished is just proof of a unjust leadership.{/i}

No choice chosen.

Times are getting intense these days.

We are on the edge of total war - {i}again{/i}.

I began to adjust my eyes and get used to who was around me.

Resting my eyes on the previously known "Silhouette" I recognised him as
"Professor Po-YeurtTarng".

Professor Po Yeutarng is a lawyer who is quite well connected wtih Kuomintang
"Hawks".

"Hawks" in the sense that they perch on your shoulder and are aggressive in
every action they take.

The Professor's very close with my uncle "Ku Hong-Meng".

A scholar who used to work in Peking before he became "enlightened" in a
lifestyle of spiritual content and cosmic toiling.

A full time Taoist in essence.

Professor Po Yeutarng on request of Uncle Ku had come to interview me to clear
of any charges or suspicions with communist acivity.

All three of us knew that I was in no way connected with communists or had any
clear sympathies for them.

The interview still had to be carried out superficially... just to clear my
name.

It was also a good oppurunity to evaluate my situation and possible choices.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Are you Ready Fang?"

Choice: Yes I am Ready.
Choice: Please Give me a minute to think.

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well Let us start now."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The hawks want to know more about you this will information will help you
reflect on what you want to do with the looming war."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War's harsh isn't it?"

Professor Po bit his lip and focussed on the blank piece of paper in front of
him.

Fang Jie
"Yeah it is..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Lets start off with being realistic."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Your hometown."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What is your background in terms of location?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I know you and your family have moved places over the years..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's best to choose what is your go-to "home"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Where is it most convenient for you to return home? What would your gut
feeling say?"

Choice: Peiping
Choice: Nanking
Choice: Kwangchow
Choice: Hong-Kong
Choice: Macau
Choice: Taiwan

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Well, the capital is a good place."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Nationalists would fight to the death to keep it safe."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt the Japanese would get that far to Nanking anyway."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt it too. I can't predict how the war will go, but the capital city
will be heavily defended."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Your hometown seem to be out of harms way and strife."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"The only issue is that it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"What's wrong with that?"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's an international settlement area."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the Opium wars and the onset of unequal treaties an international zone
was established."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's under Kuomintang sovereignty but areas of it are allocated to the
French, British etc."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"While the Japanese don't have any legal right that I'm aware of they have an
"unofficial settelemt" in Kongkew."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It's called "Little Tokyo"."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"That means Shanghai is the gateway to Chinese territory."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"If you're going to be in Nanking you have to be aware of that."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They might as well just leap frog the legal framework of the Shanghai
International Zone."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"War is chaotic and often..."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Unpredictable."

Uncle Ku has listened with extreme curisoity.

It seemed this was the first time he had learnt about the legal status of
Shanghai.

Fang Jie
"That's so interesting."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I could be a military strategist with this much analytical skill."

He gave a dry laugh.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Anyway lets get going with the questions."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So what are you doing in Peiping right now?"

Choice: Attending school as a student.
Choice: Working as a scholarly apprentice under my uncle
Choice: Working here to send money back home.
Choice: Taking a break after military conscription training

No choice chosen.

{font=fonts/eng_octin_spraypaint/octin spraypaint a rg.ttf}{color=#4fc1ff}Fang

Fang Jie
"I came here to actually continue my education."

Fang Jie
"I am staying with Uncle Ku since it is close to the facilities."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I doubt schools will run under foreign occupation."

Professor Po gave a faint grin.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Well classes won't."

Professor Po raised his glass of {i}Máotái{/i} and took a sip.

He normally didn't drink heavily but Uncle Ku had handed him this as a token
of thanks for visiting me.

Giving such an expensive drink symbolised Uncle Ku's gratitude.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most students back in Dongbei would just live at the boarding school."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"They would not return to their families."

He raised the cup of {i}Máotái{/i} to his lips but didn't take a sip. {w}As if
something important crossed his mind.{w=1.2}

Professor Po Yeutarng
"After the first month a few homesick students did in fact return."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"No vandalism, no abusive powers and the old deposed emperor back on a
throne."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Most parents made kids work back on the farms or their old shanty businesses
while the Japanese and {i}Kang-te Pu Yi{/i} tried to get the old ways running
again."

I could make out the sorrow in his face.{nw}

It seemed he made himself remember something he wished to forget.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"So I guess you should head back."

Professor Po Yeutarng
"I think your family will need you more."

He looked down at his papers as he dipped the brush back into a clay pot of
ink and scribed some details on a creased paper.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"What belief system do you follow?"

Choice: Taoism and Confucianism
Choice: Buddhism
Choice: Christianity

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Ah...{w}{cps=*0.9}A fellow buddhist.{/cps}"

Professor Po sipped his {i}Máotái{/i} lightly before facing me.

Bits of his face had manifested a gradient of red.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"Have you ever heard of {i}Dhammapada{/i}? {w}{cps=*1.5}the poem of Buddha
awakening?{/cps}"

Choice: no

No choice chosen.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"It is a great poem."

Professor Po had becoem slightly{cps=*0.2}...{/cps} {w=1}intoxicated by this
point.

Despite that it seemed that Professor Po was sober enough to recite Buddhist
poetry.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}Through the round of many births I roamed{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po had in fact placed his
{i}{font=fonts/chi_pinyin/cpinyin0.ttf}Máotái{/font}{/i} down as he recited
this.

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}without reward,{w=2} without rest,{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}seeking the house-builder.{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}Painful is birth{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}again & again.{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}House-builder, you're seen!{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}You will not build a house again.{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*-0.4}All your rafters broken,{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}the ridge pole destroyed,{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}gone to the Unformed{/cps}{cps=*0.2}...{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor Po Yeutarng
"{i}{cps=*0.4}the mind has come to the end of craving.{/cps}{/i}{nw}"

Professor seemed to become internalized during the recital of this poem.

In his red intoxicated face, you could see his expression of grattitude and
servility.

Professor Po seemed to increasingly become unable to stay...{w=1.0}sober.

Ku Hong-Meng
"He might need to take some rest."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He grew up around the drink."

Uncle Ku grabbed Professor Po by his arms and mounted him on his back.

Professor Po only slurred some words as Uncle Ku dragged him to a guest room.

I guess{w=1.0} the interview will be conducted later.

I turned my head around to the Taoist Shrine.

It consisted of a {i}Yīnyáng{/i} emblem,{w=0.5} A candle that possessed a
mediocre flame,{w=0.5} and a copy of {i}Tao Te Ch'ing{/i}.

I stood up from the uncomfortable chair and approached the shrine.

It was peaceful to stand before the shrine.

I wasn't required to announce my presence.

Part of me was afraid of the new world I had stepped into.

Will the gods protect me?

Thoughts invaded my mind as I looked at the shrine.

Lúgōuqiáo Shìbiàn had begun only a few days ago.

Uncle Ku ambled out of the guest room with his hands concealed under his
robes.

He grimaced slightly at the situation.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't know what will come out of this."

He seemed to say that calmly.

Something so important...{w=1} taken so lightly.

Fang Jie
"That's fine...{w=1} I can deal with that."

Uncle Ku sat down at the shrine and opened Tao Te Ch'ing.

He was a commited reader and devotee.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go outside and find something to do."

I looked back at Uncle Ku.

He could only sigh.

That was all he could do.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}Don't worry{/cps}"

Ku Hong-Meng
"We can get ut of here in time."

Uncle Ku would reguarly meet in the village centre and talk to elders and
intelectuals about current events.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Japan is mobilising an army, they won't go further than Peiping-Tientsen,
{w=1}I've heard."

Uncle Ku felt hopeless.

Staring into those eyes felt like lies.

Fang Jie
"They keep taking from us."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I know..."

Uncle Ku didn't believe in violence,{w=1.0} he didn't feel the need to fight
back.

I had lost my composure.

I could see Uncle Ku's reaction to me lashing out after such a long time.

Pressure that had built up from everything had finally burst the bottle.

Uncle Ku looked at me solenmly.

Ku Hong-Meng
"{cps=*0.4}I'm sorry,{w=1} Fang.{/cps}"

Fang Jie
"I'm sorry too."

I turned my back and walked out of the door.

Ku Hong-Meng
"If there is a air raid just run straight to some air raid shelter."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you find a German one, priorotise that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"The German peoples don't get harassed by {i}guizi{/i}."

I had crossed the Er-men.

I kept on walking until I passed through the Da-men.

Outside was a little garden where my Great Grandfather had planted a Sakura
Tree for Sun Yat Sen's new era of the Republic.

It's a real shame I never even learnt his name despite knowing how well known
he was in this local place.

My great grandfather disliked the Qing as they were Manchus as opposed to the
Ming who were a Han Chinese dynasty.

He had a wealthy wine business which gave him the money to buy a large
{i}Siheyuan{/i}

The Sakura was planted to mark the growth a new era without the Qing.

The Sakura plant was also foreign and thus showcased his wealth when he had it
planted.

Everything I ever learnt about him indicated that...{w=1} wealth controlled
his choices.

Sadly he died before he realised how the Republic failed China.

{cps=*0.45}or the shortlived Empire before the warlord era.{/cps}

Beyond the Sakura tree was a pond he had hired workers to build.

Apart from showing off his wealth he would also use this pond to grow Lotuses.

He would grow them in bulks and sell them to Buddhists and Buddhist temples in
which he would get blessed and make money.

now..{w=1} he wasn't shallow that he did that for profit.

He was a devout buddhist.

He would donate large sums of charity to people in need and temples.

I kept walking on until the pond came into view.

Black and white pictures showed budding and blossomed Lotuses on the surface
of the water.

Earlier photos even had swans in them.

What I saw in front of me was neither.

The water was brown, murky and thick.

It was hard to believe anything nice was in there anymore.

Uncle Ku refused to spend his inheritance money on refurbishing things around
the house.

He dared not indulge in materialism and wealth of any kind.

He preferred and carried a metaphorical banner of being a rich man in poor
clothing.

I stared at the pathetic pond.

The pond that gave up on life.

Gave up on struggling.

I turned around fast before facing Lao-Chang.

We called him that because he was an old milkman who didn't want to
retire.{nw}

Hence the name "old Chang".

Fang Jie
"I would agree."

Fang Jie
"That would have been better for the community."

Lao Chang
"We have a groundwater well over on the other side that was dug by Ma Wen's
father."

Lao Chang
"It's near the animals a lot, people are scared that they'll find chicken
shit."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku is a miser wearing the mask of Taoism."

Lao Chang
"That's your opinion."

Lao Chang
"I'm sure if we held a petition he would support it."

Fang Jie
"Really?"

I wasn't sure if that would suspend my disbelief.

Lao Chang
"Calling him a miser won't do him justice."

Lao Chang
"He isn't the kind of person who spends money on themselves."

Lao Chang
"He would rather spend it to support others."

Lao Chang
"He would rather spend it to support others."

He was old enough to know how everyone functioned in this community.

Fang Jie
"If you ask him, he will."

Lao Chang laughed.

Lao Chang
"You remind me of your grandpa."

Lao Chang sat down on the damp grass next to me that faced the miserable pond.

Fang Jie
"How so?"

Lao Chang
"Whenever there was war...{w=1} the fella just got into a bad mood."

Lao Chang
"During the northern expedition when Chiang Chieh-shih tried to take back from
those warlords.."

Lao Chang
"He had a sulky mood for a week."

Lao Chang dug his hand into the basket tied to his bicycle and took out a rice
snack.

Lao Chang
"You see. {w=1}His sister was back in Kwangchow where this crazy reunifier was
wailing war and unifying cities under his control."

Lao Chang
"He wouldn't get any of her letters from kwangchow so he sulked."

Lao Chang bit into his rice snack and chewed it open mouthed.

Lao Chang
"He sent out a lot of letters to."

Lao Chang
"I wonder where they went."

Lao Chang gazed at the shitty pond. Like it was beautiful as my Great-
Grandfather had left it.

Lao Chang
"Eventually you got this shithole situation where there are so many warlords
and everyone wants to crown a new China."

Lao Chang
"Who do you think will crown a new China?"

Choice: Chiang Chie Shih
Choice: Wang Ching Wei
Choice: Li Tsung-Jen
Choice: Mao Tse-Tung
Choice: I don't know

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think Chiang Chie Shih"

Fang Jie
"He has proclaimed central government."

Fang Jie
"The warlords even cooperate with him."

Fang Jie
"It's more or less if he can centralize power to one form of government."

Lao Chang
"That's a good bet."

Lao Chang
"The national Revolutionary Army rolled over everyone in the Northern
Camapaign."

Lao Chang
"If they keep those troops moralised Dr Sun's democracy will come back to us."

Lao Chang stood up and patted off the back of his pants that had attracted
clumps of damp soil.

Lao Chang
"I gotta get going."

Lao Chang
"Wanna buy a bottle of milk?"

Lao Chang
"You can take it home early."

Fang Jie
"No thanks, I don't have cash."

Fang Jie
"Uncle Ku will pay for it at the doorstep."

Lao Chang
"I guess that suits it."

Lao Chang grabbed the handles of his makeshift bike and pushed it around.

THe odd thing about Lao Chang was that he would have a bike he would never
ride.

He would just use the basket and push it for ease.

Since he was twice the age of Uncle Ku it made sense.

The bicycle was also too small for him. {w=1}I would have assumed that this
was something thrown away by the child of some wealthy family who grew out of
the bike.

I observed Lao Chang walk off in the distance, pushing his bike and the
flicking the rusted bell that wouldn't make any sound. {w=1}That was because
there was nothing for it to strike against.

I turned and began to walk the other way.

It was a five minute walk away from the village center.

Most young boys or able men would not be welcome there.

This was because young or able men would get kidnapped by the Kuomintang army
and chained and walked down to military headquarters to forcefully enlist.

These days the reports of Kuomintang barging and taking had gone down.

My shoes rubbed in the dirt pass as I ambled on.

In 2 weekss of residing in this district I had started to memorise a map of
the place.

There were a few facilities I was going to walk past.

The most interesting was the brothel.

The sex industry had grown in Manchuria and many boys would talk about it in
the alley ways.

Over here the brothel was something that you should not be seen entering and
leaving if you wanted to have a sense of dignity.

This brothel was known as a {i}Chang San{/i} brothel.

It was like an artistic form of prostituition in which the prositute would
play the lyre, do calligraphy and do paintings.

I think it was a progressive way to humanise prostitutes.

Personally I have never interacted with a prosititute.

Nor do I have a good enough reason to.

I just don't understand their stigma in society.

Many of the girls are of varying ages from 13 to early 40s.

The place was not regulated much with ramapnt bribing and blackmail.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hey Fang!"

I turned to see her sitting in a chair outside the door.

Fang Jie
"Hey"

I did a faint wave.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Is that a wave?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"Relax, {w=1}waving back to me won't make me pounce on you."

She crossed her arms and smiled at me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have my principles."

She grinned.

I didn't know how to respond to her.

All I could give her was an awkward grin.

She giggled at my response.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Hard to believe{cps=*0.4}...{/cps}{w=1}Some {i}whore{/i} has a sense of
principle. Right?"

I looked at the ground.

At this point I had trouble making any form of eye contact.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Don't feel bad, little brother."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean, my rules are I don't drink,{w=1} I don't smoke and I don't condone
violence."

She leaned back on her chair against the chipped brick blocks.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I have a band of sisters to look after. People in my situation."

I couldn't keep being judged like this.

I felt a need to spit it out.

Fang Jie
"I don't see whatever you're doing as a bad thing."

I interrupted her mid sentence.

She gave a strange look.

Chang San Brothel worker
"Litte brother, if some alleyboy said those words to me, I'd think it's some
ploy for pity lovemaking."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I know my stigma,{cps=*1.2} don't pity me..{/cps}"

She was still in a good mood for some odd reason.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You know, the conflict happening up there doesn't bother me."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If the Japanese do take over, we will just be required to service their
soldiers instead."

She closed her eyes to laugh at herself.

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean the industry is booming in Dong-bei, so things around here will change
I guess."

Fang Jie
"Alley boys told you right?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"I mean who else will?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"it's nice talking to a non-pervert for once."

Chang San Brothel worker
"It's amazing how people can have fruitful conversations if you give them a
chance. Right Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Right."

How did she know my name?

Fang Jie
"How do you know my name?"

Chang San Brothel worker
"The other girls you flirt with when they sit outside told me so."

I felt my face go red.

Chang San Brothel worker
"You talk better to the ones your age."

Chang San Brothel worker
"I'm only a few years your senior. {w=1}A solid 19 year old."

Chang San Brothel worker
"You're disappointed. Aren't you?"

She was teasing me.

Chang San Brothel worker
"By the way, my name is Wang Yuelan."

Chang San Brothel worker
"If you ever need shelter, just ask {i}Xiao Wen{/i} to share the room."

She laughed as she opened the door and walked inside.

Rhetorics
She's implying you should use their services if you need shelter.

Rhetorics
After all you will {b}stay the night{/b} there by any way.

Vice
Well would you?

Choice: I don't indulge in such vices.
Choice: Maybe when I'm more "curious".

No choice chosen.

Vice
Vice would be proud to hear "this".

Vice
It's human to have such desires.

Interesting indeed.

They were an interesting bunch,{w=1} strange but interesting.

I kept on walking along the dirt path.

The ambient noises from the brothel faded away with my distance.

I kept walking on.

Each step one by one.

The next facility I would see would be the winery my Great Grandpa owned.

Uncle Ku had sold it when he inherited it from his father.

Uncle Ku didn't want to support himself by destroying the lives of addicts.

At first he kept it out of operation.

It would sit there 5-6 years...{w=1}undisturbed.

Then officials would come and start ordering him to do something productive
with that land and facilities.

After a few months he sold it off to some businessman from Shanghai who wished
to expand their winery business.

Now I walk past it and just look at how many cycles this building has
experienced.

I was never told why this building was built intially, since my Great
Grandfather just decided to occupy this empty place for good business.

His father ran a little business from his home.{w=1}So my Great Grandpa
decided what to do,

He moved all his stuff there and took care of it.

Eventually people began to think this abandoned building didn't host any curse
or haunted by any angry spirits.

Some wealthy people like the Ma family invested in the winery and it grew
bigger.

In about 3 years the bulding had been expanded to four times its intial size.

Over 70 people worked here for good pay.

My Great Grandpa built an expensive Siheyuan and began to live lavishly like
the Ma family.

He died believing resourcefulness and willpower outperforms fate.

I would get told all about this from the locals like Lao Chang or Ah-Mei the
educated daughter of a noble family residing here.

Eventually passing the collosal winery I began to see the village centre in
sight.

It wasn't a centre where you would assume it was a meeting spot.

It was a noodle shop run by the Guo family.

Everyone would come and eat there once in a while and that became the de-facto
village centre.

It was run by two brothers around my age.

The older was Guo Heng, who took over the shop when his father passed away
from a stroke two years ago.

He raised his younger brother to learn to cook as well.

Eventually they got their skills developed and Guo Heng got to send his
brother "Guo He" to school.

I have met Guo Heng only a few times,{w=0.5} but he is very interesting to
talk to.

He has developed a passion for making all kinds of noodles.

Last time I visited him he showed me his father's recipe that had been handed
down for god knows how long.

He offered to employ me to his noodle shop if I ever needed a place to work.

Despite being 23 years old Guo Heng was arguably graying from his stress.{w=1}
Something he always loved joking about with the other villagers.

The noodle shop even had a banner which would ostentaciously show off its
wealth and success.

In short, if there was any celebration, meeting, or festival, Guo's noodle
shop was the place.

Mostly because it was the most central and most convenint for everyone to meet
at.

I passed through and entered the store.

Guo Heng had sat on a table and was appying a dirty rag to wipe the sweat off
his face.

The summer sun was strong and it didn't help he cooked behind a fire all day.

Guo Heng seemed to age faster everytime I visited him.

His body had become more built and skinny while his face became browner with
more wrinkles.

His hair had remained the same, {w=1}Little whisks of grey popping out once in
an occassional spot.

Guo Heng looked up at me with his brown eyes that resembled foreign
manufactured chocolate.

Guo Heng
"Fang!{w=1}{nw}"

I sat down opposite on the same table he was sitting at.

Fang Jie
"Hey, Heng"

It was midday and the sun was now forcing its heated will on us like spears.

At the highest point in the sky, a false inferno had formed.

Fang Jie
"You must hate the sun so much if you go through this everyday."

Guo Heng gave a smirk and dabbed his white dirtied rag on his face.

His shirt had wet patches near his armpits and chest.

Guo Heng
"I think its fair."

Fang Jie
"How is this fair?"

Guo Heng was quite wise because the elders would gather here and include him
in philosophical talks.

Guo Heng
"There are two things in this world which are fair."

Guo Heng
"THese two things never judge...{w=1}never discriminate."

He dabbed the cloth on his face again.

Guo Heng
"The first is death. In this world God and the Devil may judge you, but death
will come for you, no matter how good,{w=1}how bad, or whatever you are."

Guo Heng
"Death doesn't pick favourites."

Guo Heng
"The Second is the sun."

Guo Heng
"For Aeons the Sun had given light regardless of the morality of the creature
receiving it."

Guo Heng
"The sun when it's too hot will feel this way to everyone."

Guo Heng
"If the sun isn't judging than whatever the sun does,{w=1}is fair."

Fang Jie
"You really learn some interesting stuff from those elders."

Guo Heng
"I know right."

Guo Heng
"They don't have anything to do, so i give them discounted noodles and educate
myself."

I looked up at the sky

It was clear and cloudless.

Fang Jie
"Don't you get worried about the Japanese?"

Heng looked up to the sky.

Guo Heng
"I heard they're readying air raid shelters because the Japanese are mobilsing
for a full attack."

Guo Heng
"Maybe I'll have to learn to cook Ramen."

Fang Jie
"What about your younger brother?"

Guo Heng
"I'm planning to send him to Nanking where he will be safer."

Heng dabbed the cloth on his face again.

His hair had beads of sweat bouncing but never dropping off.

Fang Jie
"Really?"

Guo Heng
"It's a good idea to evacuate before they start fighting."

Guo Heng
"Ma Wen told me that the Shanghai International Zone would become a passage of
entrance for the Japanese."

Guo Heng
"He advised me not to send Guo He to Shanghai."

Guo Heng
"Hence I chose Nanking."

Guo Heng
"The Japanese would probably confiscate the shop and make me do work without
profit."

Fang Jie
"That is true."

Fang Jie
"I'm from Nanking"

Guo Heng
"The capital itself."

Guo Heng
"What is it like there?"

Guo Heng applied the rag to his sweaty face again.

Fang Jie
"Nanking in it's name means "Southern Capital"."

Fang Jie
"The first time it ruled a united China was in the Ming Dynasty."

Fang Jie
"It's a nice place to live overall."

Fang Jie
"It has a powerful inland port and it's close to Shanghai."

Fang Jie
"If you're rich then you're like a foreigner.{w=1} You dress pretty or look
handsome."

Fang Jie
"There's a lot of people there and you even have western Churches propped up
in some places of the city."

Fang Jie
"Due to these churches, chinese children of Christian believers learn English
well and proficiently."

Guo Heng looked at me bewildered.

Guo Heng
"Can you speak English?"

He looked so excited for some reason.

Fang Jie
"A bit,{w=1} I can communicate a good amount with some American residents."

Guo Heng
"What other kind sof foreigners are there in Nanking?"

I sat back and thought a little.

Fang Jie
"You have German businessmen from the German Reich with their families that
settle her to manage German businesses in China."

Fang Jie
"Some German military officiers also train Chinese troops, like General
Alexander von Falkenhausen."

Fang Jie
"He is the military advisor to Chiang Chieh-Shih for their joint military
reform program."

Fang Jie
"You have Japanese people too, who initially settled in the Japanese sector of
Shanghai and moved to Nanking but you don't see them around too often."

Fang Jie
"Other europeans are rare to see, apart from some British who do business with
Americans."

Guo Heng
"I guess Nanking is becoming a global city."

Fang Jie
"I'd say the same thing."

Guo Heng
"At least foreigners are cooperating rather than invading us.{w=1} Apart from
Japan."

Guo Heng cursed under his breath.

He dabbed the rag once again.

Guo Heng
"Is there anything special in the capital city of the republic?"

Fang Jie
"There is a statue of Chiang Chieh-Shih in the middle of the city."

Guo Heng
"What about Dr Sun?"

Fang Jie
"He doesn't need a statue."

Fang Jie
"He has a big Mausoleum called "Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum" which I think gives his
legacy justice."

Guo Heng
"What's in the Mausoleum now?"

Fang Jie
"A marble sarcophagus."

Fang Jie
"and a ceiling with the Kuomintang sun stretching above."

Guo Heng
"How's house arrest been?"

Fang Jie
"It's been fine."

Fang Jie
"I've managed to learn more about my "ancestral land"."

Fang Jie
"Sadly I can't stay here for long."

Guo Heng
"Why so?"

Fang Jie
"There's a war going to start."

Guo Heng
"I guess that makes sense."

There was nothing to say.

It was a bit awkward but it was difficult to articulate conversation.

I don't have in the slightest an idea of what to do.

Choice: Keep conversing with Guo Heng.
Choice: Take leave

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I think its time I get moving."

Fang Jie
"I have a pending interview to undergo."

Fang Jie
"He should be coming to conduct it soon."

Guo Heng rubbed the rag on his face.

Guo Heng
"I have to work anyway."

Guo Heng
"It was nice to talk with you Fang."

Guo Heng stood up.

Guo Heng put down his sweat rag.

The sun was piercing through his thin ragged shirt.

You could see how the sweat now made the shirt a paint to his canvas of a
skin.

Guo Heng
"No offense Fang,"

Guo Heng
"I have work now."

Guo Heng
"I can't afford always taking a break."

Guo Heng
"It takes time to make preparations for a meal."

Guo Heng stood up.

I grinned at him as well.

It was pleasant.

Guo Heng was now slaving away in his kitchen once again.

I stood up and walked outside and began to think.

Visiting the village temple was an opportunity to calm myself down and think
about life.

I'd often get to sit and think.

It was almost as quite as the libraries in Peking University.

The temple wasn't far from Guo's noddle shop.

I began to amble to my destination.

The temple had been around since the inception of the village.

It was the oldest unchanged object in this whole place.

It is rumored that the village was built by rich landowning elites in the Ming
dynasty.

It would make sense to see why this village is prosperous more than most.

Apart from that there is also a gilded reputation of this place.

It is prosperous but on the backs of laborers and rural wanderers or military
deserters.

People like {i}Ma Shih{/i} often hired these desperate people for cheap and
made them do things well beyond their pay.

It's no rumor that a few times a month the newly hired workers on his farm are
either hospitalized or were seen running away.

Lao Chang used to work for Ma Shih's father who was a complete opposite in
fact.

Lao Chang deifies that man because of him Lao Chang had a place to stay and
never felt an empty stomach for 15 or so years.

Then he died and his cheap cruel son took over the farm and made it much more
sinister.

Its a thought that keeps me up at night.

Maybe it's why these poor dis-empowered people turn to communism.

After all why defend something that oppresses you?

As I keep walking, other thoughts amble into my mind.



I knelt down and kept my eyes closed.

I was so calm I could hear my own heartbeat.

Monk
"How are you feeling?"

I opened my eyes once more.

Monk
"You seem much more calm than when you entered this place."

A monk wearing the orange robes was standing in front of me with a gentle
smile.

Monk
"I'm glad to see that."

The monk turns around and orders a temple worker something in a foreign
language.

Monk
"Don't take offense to that."

Monk
"I speak in my dialect."

Monk
"I just told him to bring you some water."

Monk
"This temple is just as much of a house for me and him."

Monk
"That's why all visitors are treated as guests."

Monk
"I would just like to request we do not entertain ourselves to discussion
here."

Monk
"It's a place of worship."

Fang Jie
"Ah.. Sure."

Monk
"Thanks for understanding."

I follow the Monk into a small room.

Monk
"This place was donated to by Ma-Shih."

Monk
"I'm happy that he is so generous to us."

Monk
"That man I asked to get water for you used to work for Ma-Shih."

Monk
"He took refuge here 2 winters ago."

Monk
"Ma-Shih fearing for his existence gave colossal donations to the temple as a
result."

Monk
"I wonder if such acts bear one fruit."

Monk
"What would you think?"

Choice: People fear ruining their eternal afterlife.
Choice: People are naturally selfish.
Choice: In the end it doesn't matter, it's better to live nicer when alive.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"People do the wrong thing and try to make up for it."

Fang Jie
"I feel they don't realize it's better to just avoid doing the wrong thing."

Monk
"Of course, I would agree with that."

Monk
"Yet I could argue that the money from Ma-Shih to the temple allows that man
to live safely and comfortably."

Monk
"Such thoughts shouldn't plague ones mind."

Monk
"Allowing things to be carried on your shoulders mentally is what creates the
burden and worrying we want to run away from."

Monk
"I don't know your story."

Monk
"I don't know why you came in here looking so upset before your "prayer"."

Monk
"I'm glad you have subdued your frustrations."

Monk
"but you must learn to control them at will."

The temple servant strolled in with a glass of water.

I assume they had to use the temple well to get the water which would explain
the wait.

Monk
"Do you recognize him?"

I looked over at the fresh face of the temple servant.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid not."

Monk
"He is Ma-Wen. The son of Ma-Shih."

Ma Wen
"Namaste."

He did a slight bow as he did this.

Ma Wen
"Have some water to drink."

Fang Jie
"Sure.. Thank you."

Ma Wen
"You're welcome."

I picked up the glass of water and drank it down to drown my sense of
surprise.

Ma Wen
"Don't drink so fast."

Ma Wen took a seat on the same bench as the Monk.

Ma Wen
"It's true, I am Ma-Shih's son."

Choice: Why hasn't he taken you back yet?
Choice: Why did you of all people run away?
Choice: What will you plan on doing further on?
Choice: What about the rest of your family?
Choice: Was leaving behind so much wealth worth it?
Choice: >> So the temple is your new life?

No choice chosen.

Ma Wen
"Yeah."

Ma Wen
"I probably won't get an inheritance either."

Ma Wen
"Nothing to return to."

Ma Wen
"So I'm going to try and live a good life wherever I may be."

Monk
"Quite the story."

Monk
"I don't judge people so I took him in."

Monk
"Different lives don't matter as long there is mutual respect."

Monk
"When he came here, he was just like you."

Monk
"Everyone has a struggle."

Monk
"Listening to others will ease that feeling that no-one understands your
burdens."

Monk
"Stories are a window to empathy."

Ma Wen sat there unmoving.

He seemed eerily... stolid.

Monk
"I'm here to talk if you want."

Monk
"What about you Ma-Wen?"

Ma Wen looks up from the floor.

Ma Wen
"I shoud attend to some duties."

Monk
"I guess that's alright."

Ma Wen ambled out the door.

Despite that I could still feel his cloud of melancholy.

Monk
"Don't overthink it."

Monk
"It will take time for him to come to terms with these feelings."

Monk
"Self hate is a poison in which time is its antidote."

Fang Jie
"I guess I can agree with that."

The Monk retreats back into his mind to think for a moment.

Monk
"You've only been around here for two weeks right?"

Fang Jie
"Yes, that's right."

Monk
"Why are you here?"

Fang Jie
"There's too many reasons for that."

Monk
"Will you walk South?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not sure about that."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to drop everything and run."

Fang Jie
"I don't want to get caught in crossfire."

Fang Jie
"Or enslaved by the army."

Monk
"All fair crticisms."

Monk
"I can't disagree with that."

Monk
"Have you talked to Ku Hsien-Sheng?"

Fang Jie
"No I have not yet..."

Monk
"I have a good feeling about you."

Monk
"I feel the same way about Ma-Wen."

Monk
"I won't be moving an inch from here."

Monk
"That is my personal choice."

Monk
"You..."

The monk looked at the ground for a second.

Monk
"You're young."

Monk
"You don't deserve to get invovled in this."

Monk
"You have a whole life ahead of you."

Monk
"Every choice you make counts."

Monk
"If you don't mind can you help me out with some serivce preparations?"

Monk
"It will be best to give Ma-Wen a rest for today."

I stand up and thank the Monk for his hospitality.

He doesn't reply but retort with a smile.

I walk past the rooms and the deity room to the outside wind.

The wind was gentle and inviting as I stood and absorbed it's chilled
sensations.



I seemed to have a lot of work left.

Normally I would be in the urban districts of Peiping where you could see
people from all places gather.

Even the Japanese across the Marco-Polo Bridge.

I would attend Peiping university so I could work abroad.

Strangely my dreams seem to force me to run away from my current situation.

I begin to walk back home as my books are there.

How would I confront Uncle Ku?

I felt like I has strained things again.

Part of me always does this.

Part of me always blames me for blaming myself for things outside of my
control.

I realize I always dwell on such trivial matters.

It's strange really.

I guess this walk didn't get me anything.

I felt my leather shoes grind the dust as I ambled.

Is my education even a priority?

{i}I should be evacuating... right?{/i}

The Chang San Brothel was now in view again.

Chang San was not even its name, it was just a type of brothel.

I never bothered asking the name anyway.

Was it important to know its name?

I began to speed-walk at this rate.

The wine factory that was supposed to be starting up soon will now be left
decrepit.

I wonder what the soldiers would do to it when they occupy it.

Yue-Lan has already expressed what the soldiers would do with the brothel
under occupation.

It didn't strike me as surprising in any sense.

They would probably start up the factory with some volunteers and drink till
they drop.

I kept on walking for what felt like 10 minutes until the pathetic pond came
back into view.

The pond in my eyes resembled an animal that was wounded and in pain.

Like it needed to be put out of its misery.

It would also be a breeding ground for ill stuff.

The water is brown and god knows that is swimming in there.

I gaze away and walk back in through the Da-men.

I couldn't hear Uncle Ku doing anything at the alter.

I wonder if he is home.

I have to find my books and start reading.

I chose courses in law at Peking university.

I seemed to have a strong sense of civil justice since I was young.

When you're a kid and you feel like the leadership has failed you then you
grow up wanting that to change.

Perhaps my determination to change a faulty system came from a hatred of its
failures.

I can't even understand my own intentions for such ambitions but I persist.

I reject the alternate options.

I dragged a book off of the shelf and put it on my table.

One day I wish I could become part of this system and hopefully steer it
towards a path for the better.

Time to study.

I recited the final quotes and notes to cement them in my head.

Studying like this has helped me become more calm.

It's all I have these days.

Working towards more work.

{i}I'm such a workaholic{/i}

Uncle Ku still hasn't come back even despite the fact I had studied to just
above an hour.

I wonder if he was called to a meeting.

Surely I would meet them on the way to Guo's shop.

Perhaps he was talking with some workers on building air raid shelters.

Uncle Ku is well connected with people in high places, perhaps an officer
informed him to undertake responsibility to dig air raid shelters.

After all they might start bombing any day soon when they're mobilized.

The thought of war...

It still haunts me.

Will people be able to keep their sanity after witnessing near death,
bloodshed and regular bombing?

In all honesty I have doubts on my capacity to handle the terrors of war.

I'm not some mythological hero who can fight till their last breath.

I just didn't want to be involved in this.

{i}Is that why I want to run away?{/i}

{i}If Uncle Ku and Professor Po realized this then this support for escaping
further south makes sense.{/i}

Beijing may be the resident of my ancestors but I have to face reality.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang?"

I sat up not expecting him to enter the house so silently.

Ku Hong-Meng
"What are you hung up about?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The hawks?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The communist accusations?"

Uncle Ku sat in silence for a few seconds before manifesting an idea.

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're hung up on Li aren't you?"

Fang Jie
"I'm not."

Fang Jie
"It does make me guilty."

Fang Jie
"But what can I do?"

Fang Jie
"If he was in my place he wouldn't be doing anything for me either."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm not here to pinpoint whose fault it is that Li is in prison."

Fang Jie
"I know."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Did you even visit him?"

Fang Jie
"I don't want to raise suspicions that I really am in kahoots with treasonous
activity."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He was your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Could you do that to a friend?"

Fang Jie
"Would I want to put my life in danger further?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"And let him suffer?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You're going to make him grow to hate you."

Fang Jie
"My hands are tied."

Fang Jie
"What can I do?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"The professor has already left."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He said the questions he asked what enough to write a statement on you that
could get you out."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I guess you're out of the trouble now aren't you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Maybe do something similar for your friend."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Don't throw your friend into a hole."

Choice: Don't worry. I know the right thing to do.
Choice: There are bigger things to worry about right now.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I won't stab him in the back like that."

Fang Jie
"I'll try and help him out when I have time."

Uncle Ku gave a pleasant smile upon hearing this.

By the way...

Fang Jie
"I've been thinking about it."

Fang Jie
"We should walk south far away from the conflict."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you crazy?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Why would you want to do that?"

Fang Jie
"To stay safe!"

Fang Jie
"Why else would I want to escape a bloodbath?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You are telling me that I should leave my land like food on a platter for
some invaders?"

Fang Jie
"If it means that we will live for another sunrise.."

Fang Jie
"then YES!"

Uncle Ku had a look of disbelief painted on his face.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Are you out of your mind?"

How the hell should I approach this?

Choice: They aren't like how they were in Manchuria.
Choice: Listen to yourself!

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"Do you honestly in your own right mind think that standing upright while they
carry guns will change anything?"

Fang Jie
"It may be nihilistic but"

Fang Jie
"In this scenario it's realistic."

Fang Jie
"We have to make concrete decisions now."

Choice: I'm leaving for South whether you like it or not
Choice: It will be better if you could come.

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I'm afraid I will have to go to Nanking."

Fang Jie
"I know this might be harsh but I don't want to leave you behind at all
costs."

Fang Jie
"That is why I need you to come with me."

Fang Jie
"Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't there some friend in Qingdao you can
contact?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I accept your goodwill and honest intentions for my safety."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I also have some disagreements."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You got accepted into Peking university."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You joined a protest about things that matter to you and to you only."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Now you are forcing my own hand to your will."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you noticed how self-entitled you are?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"You've only been here two weeks and I'm starting to see a controlling trait
of yours emerging."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Fang you don't need to be {i}this{/i} rash."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'm sorry."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I may be that old traditional thinking fundamentalist."

Ku Hong-Meng
"But my choices will remain my choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You can leave."

Uncle Ku sat on the guest bed.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any hard feelings from what is a natural response to fear and
danger."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Out of goodwill I can help prepare you."

Choice: Thank you.

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep your admission papers with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Peking university might move during wartime like any other kind of business."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Even after the war when it returns it will be nice to have your spot
guaranteed."

Uncle Ku scratched his head as he thought.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you still have the work recommendation letter from Cheung?"

Rhetorics
A rhetorical question.

Ku Hong-Meng
"Keep that with you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you could find some kind hearted foreigner to work for then most of your
tantrums will go silent."

Ku Hong-Meng
"You should go to Tsingtao."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Over there I have an academic colleague by the name of Wang P'u Ch'en"

Ku Hong-Meng
"He's quite rich. Rich as me I would say."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He has a wife who is referred to as "Lady Wang"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Her full name is Wang Yue Hsiang but don't ever refer to her with that."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I will write a letter to him explaining him to take you in for as long as you
need to be dependent on him or leave further south."

Ku Hong-Meng
"After all he owes me."

Choice: Why?

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I sponsored his education and accommodation with my house and inherited
wealth."

Ku Hong-Meng
"His success today is due to my input."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Since he owes me he can't turn you away."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I doubt he would have turned you away even if he didn't owe me."

Ku Hong-Meng
"This sort of goodwill comes in handy down the line you see."

Uncle Ku kept on dabbing the brush in ink and sliding it elegantly across a
piece of paper approximately the size of a table-top world map.

Ku Hong-Meng
"By the way Fang."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Have you heard of {i}I Kuan-Tao{/i}?"

Choice: No

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's a sect of a larger religious movement that gained popularity after the
fall of the Empire."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I Kuan-Tao is a belief of salvation of the individual and of society."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is actually studying about the sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I need to tell you two things in regards to it."

Ku Hong-Meng
"First you need to stay away from that sect."

Ku Hong-Meng
"By that I mean don't believe in what they tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Besides you might get sucked into more obscure and shadowy organizations."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Secondly if you can help Wang P'u Ch'en gain insight into the organization
then you can prolong your stay with him indefinitely by paying him with
"intel"."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Provided you don't fall victim to their lies."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Wang P'u Ch'en is eying them carefully."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I put down in this letter than you might be willing to help him out on
learning about it in exchange for living space."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When you reach there make your own choices."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Here you go."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I forgot to tell you."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Professor Po will stay in contact also."

Ku Hong-Meng
"He'll use his connections to help you out if you need help."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Just keep track of how much you {i}owe{/i} him."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Let me walk you off tonight."

Ku Hong-Meng
"God knows what will come out of this war."

Ku Hong-Meng
"When the war ends feel free to come back here."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Or go wherever else you want."

Ku Hong-Meng
"I'll keep sending letters to you in Tsingtao unless the Japanese begin
intercepting them."

Ku Hong-Meng
"If you do decide to go further south then inform me so that I can keep in
contact."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Do you have a torch or anything?"

Ku Hong-Meng
"It's pretty dark out there."

Choice: No

No choice chosen.

Ku Hong-Meng
"I don't have any lanterns around."

Ku Hong-Meng
"Will you be able to make it still?"

Fang Jie
"Sure, I can."

Fang Jie
"Thanks for everything."

Uncle Ku gave a faint smile.

Something you don't normally expect from him.

It was nice I guess to be sent of with a smile.

even if I did speak to him like that.

I hope it didn't leave any hard feelings.

Fang Jie
"Time to meet Guo Heng again."

I might have to make a choice on a whim tonight.

I could plan it out with Guo Heng and quickly pack to go on ahead.

I would still need to talk to Uncle Ku about this.

I should try to make him leave with us to Tsingtao for the timebeing.

Then we can make more long term decisions about how to go up against the war.

Besides with Uncle Ku on our side the financial aspect of the group will be
fixed.

By now the sun was setting.

Darkness was slowly invading the battlefield of the sky.

This scenery was strangely cathartic.

I wonder how many days it will take to experience this tranquil atmosphere
once again.

I absorbed the sweet image into my memory.

I began to walk down that path I had walked down a few times today.

Objects becoming more and more like silhouettes.

I kept walking ahead.

I had to rush ahead to Guo Heng's shop.

I was under the impression that Guo Heng would know what was to be done next.

At night sneaking past the Chang San is bad news.

If anyone sees me like this...

{i}boy, the rumour's won't stop{/i}

You could see the windows of the Brothel had candlelights in some rooms and
electricity in some others.

Grunts and moans also leaked through the window.

God knows how many unloyal men were in there.

I squinter off of the dirt path into the darker edges of the trees shielding
me from the moonlight.

Choice: Peak at who enters and leaves.
Choice: Move on towards Guo's shop

No choice chosen.

Guo Heng's shop is in the distance and he has a few lanterns lit.

I hurriedly sneak over while trying to avoid tripping up on anything.

It was a few minutes away if I had to sneak.

I kept my eyes on the lanterns.

My eyesight could not make out what characters were painted on his lanterns
but they shone bright.

Like the end of a dark hopeless tunnel.

Guo Heng's lantern felt like... {i}hope{/i}.

I keep my breath under control and made sure to keep my feet stable.

Skidding down the bank of dirt I regained my balance and reached Guo Heng's
shop.

Guo Heng signalled something to me using his hands.

Abstraction Compeherension
He's telling you to come over but quietly.

I kept going until I was within talking range.

Guo Heng
"Glad you made it Fang."

Fang Jie
"Same here."

Guo Heng's shop had padlocks on every door and boards nailed into any open
window like entrance as well.

Guo Heng
"It's got to go Fang."

Guo Heng
"It'll probably be blown up by the time I get back but at least my brother
will be safe."

Guo Heng
"Plus I saved up enough in the last 6 months."

Guo heng scans around the lantern lit shop.

I wasn't the only one there.

Guo Heng
"This is Ma-Wen."

Fang Jie
"I know him."

Ma Wen
"Nice to see you again."

Fang Jie
"Same here."

Fang Jie
"you're leaving with us also?"

Ma Wen look into the lunar skies beyond.

Ma Wen
"The monk urged me to go."

Ma Wen
"He said I got a whole life ahead of me."

Ma Wen
"Plus he pretty much kicked me out for that."

Guo Heng had been watching us two talk it out.

Guo Heng
"Good to see we all know each other then."

Guo Heng
"Here's the plan right."

Guo Heng
"Da-Yu is out back with a truck."

Guo Heng
"He does deliveries for my supplies."

Guo Heng
"Bring stuff from as far as Ning-Po to over here in Peiping."

Guo Heng
"It's not his job but he makes a good ammount of money on the side by doing
people favours."

Guo Heng
"His boss hasn't caught him since all his side business stuff is en-route."

Guo Heng
"Anyway Da-Yu says that passengers should chip in their shares depending on
how far we are going to decide to go."

Ma Wen
"I don't give a shit how far we go."

Guo Heng eyes him nervously as his vision darts back to me.

Guo Heng
"What about you Fang?"

Fang Jie
"I'll need to drop off at Tianjin for a quick talk to a friend of mine."

Guo Heng
"You mean he'll come with us?"

Fang Jie
"No, probably not."

Guo Heng
"Why?"

Fang Jie
"He's locked up and in custody."

Guo Heng
"Why do you need to see him then?"

Choice: He's my friend
Choice: I made a promise to someone

No choice chosen.

Guo Heng
"Either way we can't stay there for too long."

Guo Heng
"It will be dawn or ealier when we reach there."

Guo Heng
"You think they'll let you in?"

Fang Jie
"I think they will."

After all my name has been cleared...

After that I have a stop...

Fang Jie
"Tsingtao"

Guo Heng
"Why Tsingtao?"

Fang Jie
"My uncle Ku has a friend there who is indebt to him."

Fang Jie
"I have a written notice from my Uncle to take me in his hospitality while the
war doesn't reach the Shandong province."

Guo Heng
"Depends how fast troops strorm through Hopeh."

Ma Wen
"The Japanese are better than us anyway."

Guo Heng
"Why say that?"

Ma Wen
"Hav you seen the state of our army?"

Ma Wen
"They got to kidnap and chain men to force them to serve."

Ma Wen
"The republic is a fucking failure, that's what."

Ma Wen cynically stated this.

A cigarette would have fit this persona more.

Guo Heng
"What about us two?"

Fang Jie
"I can try to find space for you guys."

Guo Heng
"You would?"

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en is quite influential there."

Fang Jie
"I think he can pull some strings for you guys."

Guo Heng
"I still think we won't be there for very long."

Guo Heng
"Besides I need to get to Guo He in Shanghai."

Ma Wen
"Plus that damn cult of I-Kuan-Tao is there."

Ma Wen
"Doing their weird cult shit and whatever."

﻿--- Thu Jul 09 18:46:31 2020

Guo Heng
"That too."

Fang Jie
"Well we can get some letters sent to Guo He in Tsingtao."

Fang Jie
"Wang P'u Ch'en can write something for you anyway."

Guo Heng's face lit up at this.

He seemed elated at this.

Guo Heng then gets up and stretches before walking out to the back where the
truck should be.

Ma Wen
"Moment of truth?"

Fang Jie
"I guess so."

Fang Jie
"Let's go talk to Da-Yu."

I walk ahead into a dimly lit area behind the shop.

Da-Yu
"Tientsin, Tsingtao and Shanghai?"

Da-Yu
"What are you all scouring the coast for?"

Guo Heng
"We all have plans I guess."

Ma Wen
"I just don't want to die in the middle of a shootout."

Da-Yu smirks at Ma Wen.

Da-Yu
"I like how this one speaks."

Guo Heng
"That's Ma Wen."

He points to me.

Guo Heng
"That's Fang."

Da-Yu
"Just Fang?"

Fang Jie
"Just Fang for now."

Da-Yu shook a box of cigarettes and bit down on a roll.

Da-Yu
"Any of you want to try?"

Ma Wen
"Aren't they crazy expensive?"

Da-Yu brought out a foreign imported lighter up to his roll clamped between
his lips.

Flicking the box till it beamed with life.

Da-Yu
"They're expensive cause' they're classy."

Guo Heng have a small nod.

Ma Wen stared at him blankly.

Guo Heng
"How much do we all chip in?"

Da-Yu
"I'm stopping up at Tientsin for a delivery."

Da-Yu
"Your friend here can get off as well but only for 30 minutes."

Da-Yu looked at his pocketwatch in his pocket.

Da-Yu
"Then you all want to go to Tsingtao for a few days."

Da-Yu
"If I drop you all off there then chip in 80 Fabi."

Guo Heng
"That much?"

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this."

Da-Yu points to the truck.

Da-Yu
"The shit that runs this{fast} is subsidized by my employers like crazy."

Da-Yu
"Lowest I'm going."

Ma Wen
"I only got 50 on me."

Da-Yu
"Get these two to help you out."

Da-Yu
"If you all went to Shanghai-Nanjing area then boy your wallets would be dry."

Da-Yu
"Anyway time to chip in."

Choice: Pay Ma-Wen's chip
Choice: Let Guo Heng pay for Ma-Wen

No choice chosen.

Fang Jie
"I can."

Ma Wen
"Really?"

Fang Jie
"Sure, why not?"

Ma Wen
"Ma Wen looked glumly before Da-Yu took the bill into his hand."

Da-Yu
"Well that settles it."

Da-Yu
"Congrats on a chance at new life."

He opens the door and hops in.

Da-Yu
"I envy you guys."

Guo Heng
"Why?"

Da-Yu
"You get to feel the cool breeze and open air space around it."

Ma Wen
"We're going to be in the back?"

Da-Yu
"It's not that bad."

Da-Yu
"Like I said.. I really do envy you."

Da-Yu
"When I start this thing up give this place a formal farewell."

Da-Yu
"Who knows what will happen to it or you."

What a depressing thought.

I walk around to the back with Guo Heng and Ma Wen.

It's dark and full of stock.

Logic
{i}Maybe he sneaks stuff from his deliveries?{/i}

It's dark and full of stock.

Logic
{i}Maybe he sneaks stuff from his deliveries?{/i}

Logic
A packet of cigarettes or maybe that pocketwatch would take a year or so to
earn.

Logic
A packet of cigarettes or maybe that pocketwatch would take a year or so to
earn.

Logic
That wouldn't explain why his clothes are so western.

Logic
He'd been caught and fired by now.

Choice: There's another reason

No choice chosen.

Guo Heng
"Get on Fang."

I grab the cold bars at the side of the back and hop on.

Guo Heng
"Surreal?"

Fang Jie
"Yeah"

Ma Wen just lies against the wall of the truck and stares up at the black
roof.

{i}To a new life{/i}

Tough times needed tough people or support.

In this case I knew what {i}I{/i} needed.

Protesting and rebelling.

Showing the power of a voice without hope.

Of harsh unfiltered criticism.

What should I expect?

Choice: {i}That was my choice; thus my consequence.{/i}
Choice: {i}Justice being punished is just proof of a unjust leadership.{/i}

No choice chosen.

This gives me a message on autority and power in this country.

It's better to not believe in it too much.

Judgement
Perhaps it is human nature to be self centered.

Judgement
How else is one expected to live in a naturally cruel world?

Choice: By cooperating and becoming strong as a group
Choice: You're right. A litte sefishness is necessary.

No choice chosen.
