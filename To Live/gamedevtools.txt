Anti-Homunculus
Fang

It whispered.

The voice was quiet yet ominous.{w=0.1} One that sent shivers down my spine.

Anti-Homunculus
Fang{cps=*0.5}...{/cps}

Anti-Homunculus
The actions of one alone does curtail in big changes.

Anti-Homunculus
More-so than you can realize due to a lack of foresight.

The coldness of the hand seemed to greedily absorb my heat.

It felt as if my body was cultivating stone out of flesh.

A painful paralysis and sense of powerlessness.

One that left me hungered and neglected.

Anti-Homunculus
Let me guide you, Fang.

The entity formed a malignant smile and looked down towards me.

My body shuddered and gazed on through the strange plane of reality I was
lying on.

{i}Somewhere between a rock and a hard place.{/i}

A world where the sun doesn't shine.

Anti-Homunculus
I wish to guide you in your potentiality for action.

Anti-Homunculus
A compatriot in your destiny.

I rubbed my head in agony and looked around the hollow landscape.

This dream came to beg the same question once more.

Expecting on of two answers.

Monotonously. Repeatedly.

What will I choose this time?

Can I accept the guidance of this "thing"?

Choice: Accept the hand
Choice: Reject the hand

No choice chosen.

The cold icy hand of the entity wrapped around my arm like a snake.

Thieving me of my energy as I felt myself fall into its grasp.

Anti-Homunculus
Never,{w=0.2} bite the hand that {i}feeds{/i} you.

Anti-Homunculus
Nonetheless, I will watch your choices with great interest.

A cloud of black mist engulfed the entity.

Part of me had felt my own essence, perhaps a reflection of self through the
entity.

Yet however its animosity towards me was questionable.

If it was going to be "challenged" it needed to be subdued or eradicated from
my mind.

In between the worlds encompassed in dreams, I lay there in the darkness.

A place that wasn't obsolete but more rather a demoralizing void of space and
time.

Perhaps a limbo?{w=0.2} A waiting place in the afterlife.

Everything was here at once.

Hopes, dreams, ambitions, weaknesses, failures...{w=0.2} - seemingly with
nothing exempted.

The only illusion being that the darkness acted as a drape over this
"everything".

This sensation of "everything" was prevalent through my bones and flesh.

This recurring dream at this point had cultivated itself as a domestic
opponent to my mind.{w=0.2} My sense of autonomy.

A harsh reality I was coerced to face.

On the other hand, like the countless times I encountered this perverse self
reflection critique, I had to make up my mind and leave.

Fang Jie
"It's time to wake up now."
