    old "The communists knew aafter the 1927 Shanghai massacre that anywhere under nationalist rule was not their home anymore. They retreated and began to cross rivers and mountains and set up a base in Shanxi to try and regroup. It seemed hope was not on their side especially at the brink of a full out war. The great march has finished and only a fraction of the red army remains at their last stand in Shanxi. After three failed Kuomintang encirclements and a respite after the Sian incident in 1936 the Chinese Soviet Republic has to keep itself together and face the adversities of foreign aggression and imperialism. Left with a barely standing army decisions have to be made and people have to join the fight to protect the sovereignty of China."

    old "The Hopeh Chahar Political Council was born in 1935 after Japan forced China's hand in the He Umezu Agreement as an attempt to end Kuomintang Influence in the Northern most provinces bordering Manchukuo and Mengkukuo. In reality the council gave lip service to the Japanese and cooperated with the Kuomintang central government. The Japanese set up the their own government in the region in East Hopeh while a majority of territory was allocated to the council. The goal to secure the 5 most northern provinces failed and forced the Japanese back on their plans for domination in China. Now the council has to choose it's path and stand up to Japanese aggression in Northern China."

    old "Shanxi Clique has been around since the 1911 Xinhai revolution and has been steady in its political and economic interests. Shanxi is a target of many desperate invaders including the Japanese, Kuomintang and the communists as part of securing northern China. Lagre iron deposits and soldier farmers roam the vast land of Shanxi as one million peasant farmers and labourers are becoming introduced the the marxist theories from the Yan'an communists. In 1936 Shanxi stood its ground against the Manchukuo and Japanese forces wishing to reunify Suiyuan under Mengkukuo by forcing military training and conscription for all students and formed an informal alliance with the communists to fend off the land grabbers of Dongbei. Where will Shanxi go? The world wonders."

    old "The Ma Clique is the North West warlord state that is run by \"The Three Ma's\". A steady and self sufficient state in which progress is focussed on living standards than war. Hsi-Pei San Ma still has conflicts with the tibetans and Ngolok that wish to take back their lands and have defended themselves throughly enough to take more land from Tibet. Fear of communism was so strong with the Ma Clique that genocide and systematic extermination against Ngolok tribes got more and more often and much more violent and brutal. A majority Islamic nation with a majority Hui Chinese population Hsi-Pei San Ma preserve their autonomy and authority with an iron fist and look forward to the future with a looming war with Japan."
