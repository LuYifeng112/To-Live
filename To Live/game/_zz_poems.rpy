    {'Dhammapada': 'Through the round of many births I roamed\nwithout reward,\n without rest,\nseeking the house-builder.\nPainful is birth\n  again and again.\nHouse-builder, you\'re seen!\nYou will not build a house again.\nAll your rafters broken,\nthe ridge pole destroyed,\ngone to the Unformed,\nthe mind has come to the end of craving.\n -Gautama Buddha 3rd Century B.C.E',
     'Tao The Water Way' : 'The best of men is like water;\nWater benefits all things\nAnd does not compete with them.\nIt dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain –\nWherein it comes near to the Tao.\nIn his dwelling, (the Sage) loves the (lowly) earth;\nIn his heart, he loves what is profound;\nIn his relations with others, he loves kindness;\nIn his words, he loves sincerity;\nIn government, he loves peace;\nIn business affairs, he loves ability;\nIn hi actions, he loves choosing the right time.\nIt is because he does not contend\nThat he is without reproach.\nLao Tzu Tao Te Ch\'ing Chapter 8'}
